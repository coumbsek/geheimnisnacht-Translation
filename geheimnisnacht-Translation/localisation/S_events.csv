EVTDESCA_spleasure10;The servant appears scared at first, but once you force him to inhale some of your ailment, he calms himself, happily joining you. The experience is even better with someone else, maybe you should convince more people to join in the future...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure10;Yes, just let your mind roam...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPspleasure10;[Root.GetFirstName] unlocked the targeted decision 'Twist'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure11;You drag the servant across the floor and press his face into your last bag of dust, leaving him shaking and choking. After some time, he finally stops, dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure11;How do you like that? What is your *soul* seeing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure12;Each day you give thanks for the inspiration that has led you thus far but although you still feel the thrill when pain dances across your flesh, as time goes on you long to feel something even harsher. As you wonder this things, you find yourself soothed by the chirping of a lovely songbird scampering near your window. For a while you simply delight in its song but eventually your thoughts begin to turn and you start to wonder if perhaps you could inspire it to even greater heights of artistry. How much more beautiful and moving would it be if he went to the same suffering as you subordinate yourself to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure12;I must know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure12;That's base, I'll cleanse this thought from my flesh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure12;That's enough, never again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure13;It's growing faint so quickly, but you cannot deny the unique and sublime tone given to birds' notes. It might have been its last song, but you're brought to tears by that very perfection you helped it reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure13;It was... enchanting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure14;You start punishing your own flesh, but as you go on, you start seeing the art of your work, the passion inside every cut. You quickly grab a mirror and start drawing red lines over your face, ecstatic at the sight of your coming masterpiece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure14;Sublime!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure15;Your scholarly studies give you plenty of time for peaceful contemplation and the enjoyment of solitude. All alone in the great library, you cannot fail to think of the books as little universes, hanging to your whims, depending on your care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure15;A slight change here or there, and history itself is rewritten!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure15;Like the world, they could have little daemons roaming inside...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure15;They should always be preserved at their best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure16;You smirk, complimenting yourself on your work and passing to the next volume. So many great deeds were committed by your ancestors you didn't know about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure16;It's like bending time itself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure17;Another little miniature is ready and you move to look for a good spot for the next one. They are so well hidden. The future generations will look at the marvels of these pages and ignore the obscenities laughing at them from the paper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure17;It's so delightful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure18;Your days of quiet enjoyment seems to have come to an end. A young apprentice has come to the library to study. A pompous, nagging little brat, asking you for directions every hour, giving you sleazy looks every time he thinks you're not watching him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure18;Your days of quiet enjoyment seems to have come to an end. A young apprentice has come to the library to study. A pretentious, nagging little brat, asking you for directions every hour, outrageously flirting as if her very presence was a gift to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure18;It's a vast and ancient library one could easily get lost in...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure18;Let's see if the brat can really handle what it craves for...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure18;Walking close to the staircase, I see? Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDspleasure18;I'll just have to bear with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure19;Who knows when the poor student is getting out of the old storage room. It's so dark and twisted, how could the brat even end there, you wonder? Here's to hoping the poor soul doesn't get eaten by rats. On the other hand, his muffled screams for help are so soothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure19;It sounds like a lullaby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure20;It wasn't so bad. The boy turned out to be experienced at least in something. And going rough with him assured you some days of quiet in the future. You couldn't deny you enjoyed having the chance to choke the little brat, if only for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure20;It wasn't so bad. The girl turned out to be experienced at least in something. And going rough with her assured you some days of quiet in the future. You couldn't deny you enjoyed having the chance to choke the little brat, if only for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure20;A teacher *should* spank their students from time to time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure21;It takes just one little trip. You have to bear the squealing voice of the annoying twerp only up to when the brat's head squashes on the floor below.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure21;What a beautiful silence. Poetic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure22;You were doing some testing for a new concoction in your laboratory, but something has gone wrong. The rat you used for your experiment has started to slowly and painfully choke after tasting the substance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure22;This needs to be closely observed, yes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure22;I'll check on it later, let's try something else first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure22;Better to end the poor creature's suffering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure23;Despite your careful examination, you cannot find the source of the problem. You have to admit to yourself though, watching the creature gasping for its last breath from above, like a passive deity, filled you with a smug sense of satisfaction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure23;It just comes with the job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure24;When you return with a new mix, you find out the rat has not yet drawn its last breath. You have it ingest the new substance and while the creature dies, there's a series of fascinating side-effects accompanying its death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure24;How interesting. I'll need another rat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure25;You really looked forward the visit of your distant colleague, you'd had a thrilling correspondence in the last months. Yet, now that you have him here, you are starting to seriously question your judgement. The short-sighted fool is dismissing many of your accomplishments, accusing you of using experiments just as a pretence to kill and torture your test subjects. He has even started to threaten you to call authorities to have you answer of some of these supposed transgressions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure25;Your brain doesn't work. Let me check it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure25;Allow me then to show you this great brew I tested on rats some time ago...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure25;Maybe he's right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure25005;Your colleague finally stops twitching. Some more stitches and he'll be free to go. Of course he was belittling you, the lymph determining his pride and envy were cluttering his brain, you had to remove an entire piece to cure him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure25005;Ssshhh, it's all over now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure26;There's no real difference. Like the rat, the scholar can only look at you from below now, in awe and terror, as he chokes on his own blood. The post-mortem reactions seem to be considerably different from your last tests with rats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure26;I should try it with more people then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure27;Since your youth you've been admired for your intelligence. Yet, at the same time, when you've put it into practice, you've always had people complain and snort, opting for the most stupid of decisions. Like the minor noble in front of you right now, bragging about his mediocre accomplishments and calling your wisdom cowardice and self-entitlement. Why gifted people such as you should suffer idiots of his sort?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure27;If you so desire, I'll humiliate you right now in front of everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure27;Speak on, I'll speak later, to the right people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure27;If I answered in kind, I'd be as stupid as he is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure28;When you're finished with him, the courtier is so ashamed he cannot spit a word back. As if it wasn't enough recounting his many failings, you inflame the court against him and he's soon driven out by shouts and threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure28;See?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure29;Seeing you not answering him, the courtier keeps on bragging, finally leaving the room when satisfied with his work. In a few days you send your people to the countryside, spreading enough vicious rumours to utterly destroy his reputation, while at the same time maintaining yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure29;That's where the genius lies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure30;The events at court in the last weeks still haunt you. The thrill, the satisfaction of having the entire court hanging from your lips, then pitted against that insufferable idiot... It wouldn't be bad to feel it again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure30;There's plenty of fools, it's only a question of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure30;No, it's not warranted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure31;You are about to send another peasant off to his ironic and well fitted punishment, when one of your spies comes whispering into your ears the bragging courtier is dead by his own hand. He committed suicide to escape the shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure31;Ah! Thus proving once more what a fool he was!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure32;You've always had a sweet tooth and enjoyed foods of all sorts, filling your belly with exotic delicacies gives you an indescribable sense of satisfaction. Yet many at court frown on your taste as inappropriate for an Elven noblewoman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCC_spleasure32;You've always exercised caution and moderation in your meals, as befitting an Elven noblewoman, yet sometimes it's really hard to say no to some new delicacy, have your stomach growl and be content with roots and vegetables.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_spleasure32;You've always exercised caution and moderation in your meals, as befitting an Elven nobleman, yet sometimes it's really hard to say no to some new delicacy, have your stomach growl and be content with roots and vegetables.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCE_spleasure32;Nobody can deny you enjoy a good celebration every once in a while. The thing is, as of late, nothing seems to excite you anymore. After years of experience, it seems you're out of ideas...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure32;They're wrong, I don't care!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure32;Maybe I could use a little moderation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure32;A little indulgence won't hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDspleasure32;No, I'm committed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEspleasure32;Or maybe not... Just need to dig *deeper*...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFspleasure32;Well, that happens when you live for centuries...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure33;Why did you even doubt yourself? This is the way you like spending your life. Why negate some simple pleasure to try and reach the unattainable ideal of Elven beauty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure33;They are just bones wrapped in judgemental skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure34;Having to let yourself go for a while was nice and all, but now you worry if you're not overdoing with all the large meals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure34;Just one more snack...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure35;Your wild feast seems a success, there's all sort of grotesque entertainment going on, things to make an Asur blush. You're having the time of your life, when some stupid page has the gall to voice his absolute repulsion for the whole spectacle, calling your guests weakling sycophants and you a depraved vixen with no shame, as if being the only one in the room to be still dressed gave him more nobility than the one in your blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure35;Pile on him! Pile on him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure35;Maybe we've gone a tad bit too far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure36;When you wake up in the morning in the garden, naked and wrapped around in a fur cloak by the statue of an Elven God-like, you can barely remember what exactly happened the night before. One thing was clear: it was awesome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure36;And whatever happened to that servant?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure37;Ignoring the courtiers' prattling seemed to quell your conscience for some time, yet now you are starting to notice how less and less dresses fit you and how tiring moving has become. You can barely fit your behind on the throne any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure37;I don't mind, it's all so good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure37;What am I becoming? Enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure38;Why others even care so much? Should you starve yourself like a peasant? They're only envious of you, that's all, they know what they're missing out. Maybe you should show them, some time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure38;Why not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure39;The Gods teach moderation and abstinence, but you've always had trouble with it. Is it so wrong to lay down for a while and enjoy a good glass of wine with some friends? Or a barrel of mead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure39;Khaine is not soft on weakness, but you've always had trouble with it. Is it so wrong to lay down for a while and enjoy a good glass of wine with some friends? Or a barrel of mead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_spleasure39;You've always followed the austere dictates of the Gods, always kept your mind clear to better fight corruption and Chaos. Yet, sometimes you envy the simple joys of inebriation and carousing. Would it be so wrong to give into it once in a while?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_spleasure39;You've never let your guard down and kept your mind clear and sharp to fight your enemies. Yet, sometimes you envy the simple joys of inebriation and carousing. Would it be so wrong to give into it once in a while?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCE_spleasure39;Nobody can deny you enjoy a good celebration every once in a while. The thing is, as of late, nothing seems to excite you anymore. After years of experience, it seems you're out of ideas...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure39;I'll drink to that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure39;Maybe I should spend more time sober...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure39;A little sip won't really hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDspleasure39;Doesn't matter. Can't afford to risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEspleasure39;Or maybe not... Just need to dig *deeper*...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFspleasure39;Well, the desensitization comes when you live for centuries...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure40;Why worry about the Gods? Surely they drink too from time to time. You remember seeing a statue of one holding a bottle. Or did you put it there one of your nights out? The memory is blurry right now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure40;If it fitted, it means *he* wanted it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure41;Since you started drinking, every night is a party, things normally so bland, suddenly become hilarious through the alcohol induced stupor. How could you miss all this for so long?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure41;Ah ah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure42;Your wild feast seems a success, there's all sort of grotesque entertainment going on, things to make an Asur blush.

EVTDESCA_spleasure43;When you wake up in the morning in the garden, naked and wrapped in a fur cloak by the statue of an Elven God-like, you can barely remember what exactly happened the night before. One thing was clear: it was awesome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure43;And whatever happened to that servant?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure44;As a mockery from the Gods themselves, the sense of inebriation has started to fade in the last days. Doesn't matter how much you drink, you can only get so little enjoyment from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure44;Time to move to something stronger than alcohol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure44;It's probably a sign of mercy. Enough of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure45;You were right, alcohol was just the tip of a great new universe of sensation you've unlocked. There are so many substances, so many ways to see the world... And those narrow-minded fools see it as weakness?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure45;I could show them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure46;Asur frown upon the weak temptation of the flesh, yet you've always had a hard time adhering to this principle. Even worst, recently nothing seems to satisfy your lust anymore. Luckily a bard that has recently come to your court gave you a good impression he could help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Luckily a bard that has recently come to your court gave you a good impression he could help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_spleasure46;Druchii women aren't exactly known for their modesty and you are no exception. Yet your lust has run somewhat dry in the last years, nothing seems to enflame it anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_spleasure46;Druchii don't mind employing all of their skills to get the favour of a Sorceress or some other Matriarch, that doesn't mean one should not enjoy the process of getting it. Sadly, as of late, you've had a hard time satisfying your lust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCE_spleasure46;You've always been praised by other Asur for your modesty and for how gracefully you've protected your virtue. Yet, from time to time, you have... yearnings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCF_spleasure46;You've always been praised by other Asur for your clear-mindedness and for how gracefully and respectfully you've treated the opposite sex. Yet, from time to time you wonder how could it be to act as some lesser kins do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCG_spleasure46;Druchii women aren't exactly known for their modesty, your prudish tendencies have always been derided amongst your peers. How could sex ever help a woman in social climbing anyway?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCH_spleasure46;You've always just wanted to mind your own plots and raids, yet you have Witches and Sorceresses of all kinds walking around half-naked day in day out. How is someone to keep his head clear and plan anything in these conditions?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure46;I could try a stronger approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure46;The fire will return, eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEspleasure46;Maybe I could try something more... unorthodox? Just once?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFspleasure46;I... no, no, no, I just can't.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure47;You push the young man on the floor, sinking your nails into his skin and twisting his arm. The woman joins you with a whip, trying to catch you off guard, but you take her wrist in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure47;You push the young woman on the floor, sinking your nails into his skin and twisting his arm. The man joins you with a whip, trying to catch you off guard, but you take her wrist in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure47;Give it to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure47;That's enough for today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure48;You lick the blood off your hands, wrapped around the two young quivering mates. You weren't so sure at the beginning, but now all sorts of nice ideas are coming to your mind for the next sessions, you've been really missing out on something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure48;Maybe I'll pick someone else, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure49;The young man straps you tighter to the bed, spitting on you and glancing at the tools to see what to use next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure49;The young woman straps you tighter to the bed, spitting on you and glancing at the tools to see what to use next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure49;Yes! Yes, tell me how I deserve this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure49;That's too much, stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure50;Once the traveller leaves you tied up in the bed, you are exhausted, but at the same time, you still yearn for more. There must be other interesting ways to experience what you did, you could make some research.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure50;Yes, very deep research.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure51;You are rightfully and justly feared by your servants and vassals alike, as proper Druchii highborn should. You are just wondering how more enjoyment did you find in exacting your punishments when a servants trips you by accident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure51;Several at court seem to dislike your harsh methods. You are just wondering how more enjoyment did you find in exacting your punishments when a courtier dares to speak against your final verdict on a peasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_spleasure51;You never really liked violence, much to the ridicule of your Druchii peers. When a farmer you just pardoned ends up in court again for stealing and pleads to you, you start seeing their point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_spleasure51;You've always kept true to the Gods and exerted kindness and good judgement in your actions. Yet, sometimes, the stupidity of your servants, the mockery of your courtiers, they really push you to edge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure51;You miserable wretch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure51;You know what? He's beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEspleasure51;That's it! Now you're getting it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFspleasure51;Patience, patience...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure52;The courtier cries for forgiveness at every lash, but you still feel like he's not had enough. Exacting the punishment by yourself, without the jailer, makes it feel so much more intimate and satisfying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure52;The servant cries for forgiveness at every lash, but you still feel like he's not had enough. Exacting the punishment by yourself, without the jailer, makes it feel so much more intimate and satisfying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure52;You think it's over? We're just getting started here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure52;I think you've learned your lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure53;You emerge the dungeon soaked in blood and with a heavy breath. The new prisoner is not getting out for some time. The wonders you did to him... It was almost artistic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure53;We need to do this more often.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure54;You have the farmer flogged on the public square. He almost looked surprised at your verdict, probably he hoped to get free again. Not anymore. And besides, watching the executioner rip the flesh from his back is so gratifying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure54;The maiden deserved that punishment, she was clumsy and irresponsible. It was so gratifying and just to give to her her rightful punishment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure54;It's your fault! You brought this upon yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure54;I'm so sorry, I don't know what came to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure55;Each wound... Is like a painting celebrating justice, it's almost inebriating. Kindness doesn't mean foolishness after all. One needs to be harsh to be loving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure55;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11142;Having to ride out or even walk after eating so much always makes you nauseous. You had also planned a fencing session today, but perhaps you should take a break...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1142;I'm not feeling like doing anything right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1142;Wouldn't be healthy do nothing after eating so much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11143;You were planning for a walk after the sixth course, but you're feeling too heavy and tired to walk anywhere right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11144;Your whole life is a failure, there is really no point in doing anything if it's always going to be the wrong thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1144;Better do nothing at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1144;I have to try, at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11145;Why even get up of bed when everything and everyone is going to be against you, each day of your accursed life? You might as well lay down and wait for death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11146;Every night is a party, things normally so bland, suddenly become hilarious through the alcohol induced stupor I'm keeping myself into. Despite a few rough mornings, I can barely remember the last time I was sad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1146;Life is good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1146;Yeah, but I can barely remember *anything* at all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11147;Another day passes by, spent sitting on my nice soft couch and gorging upon the last delicacies of my cooks. Everything would be fine, if not because I'll have to skip second breakfast tomorrow morning to let the tailor take again my measures for new clothes. Perhaps I can make the servants feed me while he works...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1147;He better take them good this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11149;I've lost every appetite. I do nothing, why should I eat anything? I'm not hungry anyway. My body has grown skinnier and sharper as days passed by, even the faintest of the noises and lights bothers me and I find harder to focus for longer times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1149;Am I dreaming right now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11154;I know the value of good work and moderation, yet my body is still cursed by past wickedness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1154;I must try to get back into shape, no matter what.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1154;I've really a lot to worry about already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11155;The rush of appetite I've been having lately has truly been good to me: I feel less tired, everyone at court says I look healthier and my bones do not stick out anymore from under my skin. I do worry about overdoing though...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1155;Nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1155;Maybe it's better to return to more frugal habits...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure56;You've discovered new depths of pleasure that most people can only dream of. Why not bestow your knowledge to others as well? You've gained the 'Twist' targeted decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure56;Magnificent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTBspleasure98;I think you're overstating things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCBspleasure101;[From.GetFirstName] has finally started to act properly, surrounding [From.GetHerHim]self with servants and maids to advise [From.GetHerHis] looks, constantly wondering what could improve [From.GetHerHis] features.

EVTDESCEspleasure101;As little as it is, [From.GetFirstName] seems to be giving some attention on how to dress and act, but that's no more than the bare minimum one would expect from everyone. There's no passion, no imagination, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't understand the art behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure101;You thought you almost saw [From.GetFirstName] staring at a mirror today, but no such luck, sadly. How can your [GetFromRelation] be still so uncaring about [From.GetHerHis] looks?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure101;Somewhere, hidden under layers of indifference, there might be a sense of aesthetic inside [From.GetFirstName]'s soul. There's still a long way to find it, though.

EVTDESCHspleasure101;How frustrating, your [GetFromRelation] seems to care as little about you as [From.GetSheHe] cares about [From.GetHerHis] looks. There seems to be no way to dissuade the [From.GetFirstName] to even look at [From.GetHerHis] reflection from time to time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCCspleasure102;At first it was just to experiment some new stuff, but now it has become more of an habit.

EVTDESCDspleasure102;Getting powders and perfumes the likes [From.GetFirstName] cannot stop from suggesting might be too much, but you've found a strange comfort in spending some time at the mirror in the morning, making sure look at your best before meeting your courtiers and friends.

EVTDESCEspleasure102;You barely noticed yourself combing your hair today. All this expectation from [From.GetFirstName] and other courtiers must have sneaked inside your head. Still, there should not be anything wrong with a few adjustments from time to time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure102;[From.GetFirstName] sent you some extremely flamboyant clothes as a gift, hoping they would help you understand the need to take care of your looks. Why does [From.GetSheHe] even care what you look like?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure102;[From.GetFirstName] would just not stop praising your looks, swearing a little care is all you need to reach true perfection. It is such a strange attitude, to think wasting so much time and wealth on mere appearances could be worth anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure102;[From.GetFirstName] has kept on bothering you with [From.GetHerHis] empty flattering, still hoping you could pick some interest in the empty praises to beauty and fashion. Sometimes you almost wish you understood what this obsession really meant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCCspleasure103;Why is it so hard? You can see [From.GetFirstName]'s harsh words were not uncalled for now, you've started looking for new ways to nurture your look, but for any spot you cover, one more springs out of nowhere, one more thing to trim, adjust, replace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure103;You've started giving greater attention to how you look and act around others, but it's still not enough, you can still hear them snickering behind your back, pointing at all the imperfections and questionable choices in attire you've picked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure103;All this sharp comments, even from other courtiers, are really starting to become unbearable. Do you really look so terrible? Maybe you could spend some time improving your image...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure103;You don't really understand [From.GetFirstName]'s attitude. First [From.GetSheHe] spends hours spitting shrouded insults at you, then [From.GetSheHe] starts spewing advices on how to improve your image. Why can't [From.GetSheHe] just think for [From.GetHerHim]self?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure103;[From.GetFirstName] is back again with [From.GetHerHis] cheap shots against you, how out of style are your clothes, how dreadful does your hair look, how much would you benefit from powdering your face. It's such a meaningless concern for you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure103;It's almost laughable how [From.GetFirstName] still is trying to make you feel some sort of shame for your looks and demeanour, as if you would care anything [From.GetSheHe] or any other empty person would think about you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZZspleasure103;I will change the flesh and reach perfection!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure103;I could... spend some more time on this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure103;I still find all this uncomfortable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure103;Enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure104;You cannot bear to be yelled at any longer by [From.GetFirstName], spewing how ugly you are yet. You must take drastic measures now. You must change what nature got wrong and move towards beauty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure104;There was no misunderstanding in [From.GetFirstName]'s yelling this time. Your appearance cannot be improved by things as limited as powders and lotions, it's your very flesh that needs to be treated. Only then you shall be able to reach perfection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure104;As you leave [From.GetFirstName] chambers after yet another scolding over your sloven looks, you start to understand what you have might be a real problem. You thought you could manage, spend more time, hire some servants to counsel you on the best way to present yourself, but it's clearly not enough. You must be a desperate case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure104;The constant threats of [From.GetFirstName] have been a huge incentive, now you have to spend at least an hour each day on the morning to make sure to look at your best. Even so, that's not even the bare minimum for your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetSheHe]'s insatiable for constant improvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure104;You really tried to to be careful, brush your hair and all such frivolous things, but it's still not enough. You were berated once more by your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. What are you supposed to do? Waste days acting like some spoiled princess?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure104;Why is [From.GetFirstName] so upset? It seems like everyday now [From.GetSheHe] has to yell at you for some wrong mannerism or supposedly dreadful hairstyle or any other entirely frivolous matter [From.GetSheHe] may think of. By this point, you wonder if it wouldn't be easier to just entertain [From.GetHerHis] ideas for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure104;[From.GetFirstName] has called you one more time for another harsh scolding over your allegedly absolute lack of fashion, making empty threats against you if you persist to keep such an uncaring behaviour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure104;How dares [From.GetFirstName] treat you like this! Summoning you, reprimanding you for slovenliness and ordering you to do something about it, as if it was any of [From.GetHerHis] business how you look.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZZspleasure104;I will change the flesh and reach perfection!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure104;I could... spend some more time on this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure104;I still find all this uncomfortable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure104;Enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure105;[From.GetFirstName] spent quite some time explaining you how [From.GetSheHe]'s not so insecure to be swayed by mere talk about [From.GetHerHis] appearance. There are better things for a man of [From.GetHerHis] stature to do than look frivolous and effeminate, if not outright perverted. It doesn't seem like you'll get anything more from this one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure105;[From.GetFirstName] spent quite some time explaining you how [From.GetSheHe]'s not so insecure to be swayed by mere talk about [From.GetHerHis] appearance. For a woman of [From.GetHerHis] calibre it would be damning to lose your reason for a self-absorbed life of frivolous nonsense. It doesn't seem like you'll get anything more from this one.You're not so insecure to be swayed by mere talk about your appearance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure105;I'm fine as I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure107;You let the blade run through your skin, as softly and firmly as possible, looking at the red line in the reflection of your mirror. Just the retouching that you needed, a more virile look, the battle-hardened warrior, the scar going just right to emphasize your good features.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure107;You let the blade run through your skin, as softly and firmly as possible, looking at the red line in the reflection of your mirror. Just the retouching that you needed, a mysterious cut, running just along the right places to emphasize your good features, making you so much more interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure107;Yes, this will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure10705;It is time to see the results of your gracious and just meddling: [From.GetFirstName] is sporting some nice new interesting looks. How much did he scream to gain his new scar, you wonder? Such a great prize, although coming from a complete different sort of battle, of which you are certainly the winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure10705;It is time to see the results of your gracious and just meddling: [From.GetFirstName] is sporting some nice new interesting looks. Normally one would consider such a cut an imperfection, but in the middle of her otherwise plain appearance, it gains such a special quality... In fact you think it might be even giving some value to her other boring features.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure10705;A good work, but perfection has yet to be reached...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure108;You let the blade run through your skin, as softly and firmly as possible, looking at the red line in the reflection of your mirror. Proceeding further, adding another line, you start seeing your design taking form. You're like a painter, you finally realize. And your face is still such a blank slate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure108;More red!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure10805;What a surprise [From.GetFirstName] revealed himself to be. Here he is, completely transfigured. His face is terrible and in this terror there is something beautiful. Some in the court might think him a madman to do this, but the fact that you alone can truly understand the greatness of his work, makes it even more sublime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure10805;What a surprise [From.GetFirstName] revealed herself to be. Few men would look at her without turning pale. But for you, she's become a forbidden beauty. The mere thought makes your skin crawl with pleasure, to dare looking at the magnificent fruits of your labour...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure10805;Perfect!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure109;The long days of studying in your laboratory, mixing potions and weaving spells have finally come to their fruition.

EVTOPTAspleasure109;Magic solves every problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure10905;[From.GetFirstName] has outdone himself. With his arts, he found a way to use the Winds of Magic as the tools to sculpt his face.

EVTOPTBspleasure110;I'll take care of my own body, thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure111;[From.GetFirstName] has become a real glutton, hardly remaining one day without stuffing [From.GetHerHis] face from morning to evening. At the end of the day [From.GetSheHe] needs servants to carry [From.GetHerHim] to bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure111;Now that [From.GetSheHe] started getting a taste of it, your [GetFromRelation] is really appreciating [From.GetHerHis] new diet, carelessly gorging on new delicacies and exotic food every day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure111;[From.GetFirstName] has finally started to stuff [From.GetHerHim]self properly, with less encouraging required on your part. Keeping on like this, [From.GetSheHe] will get as plump as you wished [From.GetHerHim] to be.  At the beginning [From.GetSheHe] was a little nauseous, but now [From.GetSheHe]'s started to crave for new dishes and spices every night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure111;Your ceaseless work has certainly resulted in some minor improvement in your [GetFromRelation]'s looks, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't shy from partaking in a large feast once in a while. You can see the first result of your influence in [From.GetHerHis] distended belly and relaxed demeanour, but there's still much to go yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure111;Your efforts managed to get [From.GetFirstName] to assume what you would consider a healthier diet, but this will still not do, [From.GetSheHe]'s still too undernourished, [From.GetSheHe] needs larger meals to recover entirely and gain the more amiable appearance you're looking for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure111;Paying some kitchen boys to hide some sugar and honey inside your [GetFromRelation]'s bread seems to have been a good idea. [From.GetFirstName] looks already less pale and starving without being any wiser.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure111;[From.GetFirstName] still completely disregards your just concerns, [From.GetSheHe]'s so disgustingly thin, always refusing any delicacy you have the kitchen boys slip into [From.GetHerHis] table. Going on like this [From.GetSheHe] might actually be getting skinnier...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure111;[From.GetFirstName] still completely disregards your just concerns, [From.GetSheHe]'s so disgustingly skinny, you could swear you see bones sticking out under [From.GetHerHis] skin, how could anyone enjoy being such a corpse?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure111;*Flatter [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure111;*Shame [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure111;*Bash [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure112;You cannot remember the last time you felt satiated, every second of your waking life is now a constant struggle against the unending hunger [From.GetFirstName]'s honeyed words have bestowed unto you. Luckily, you've found stuffing yourself until you can barely move as a more than pleasant state of being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure112;With your [GetFromRelation]'s kind guidance, your appetite has grown near insatiable. Every dinner is a feast for you and not too rarely you call your servants during the night to ask for more food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure112;[From.GetFirstName]'s insistent suggestions were all that was needed to tease your appetite. You can barely miss a day without trying something new. Your cravings having been refined as well, you can no longer feel content with the frugal meals you enjoyed before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure112;Since you've started following [From.GetFirstName]'s counsel regarding your diet, you've surely felt more relaxed and free in your choice of meals. But your [GetFromRelation] still encourages you each break to try fancy new dishes. At the end of the week you're often feeling bloated and near-sick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure112;After [From.GetFirstName]'s numerous concerned talks, you've started to indulge a little every once in a while. Everyone around you swears it has only done good to your health. It's certainly a less stressful attitude, but you still worry it could get out of hand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure112;With all the concerned praise you're receiving about your eating habits, you're starting to wonder if you shouldn't be a little less strict, if nothing for the sake of your health...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure112;It's the third time you see [From.GetFirstName] slipping something near your plate. At this point it would almost feel more unsettling if [From.GetSheHe] were trying to poison you. Naturally, [From.GetSheHe] kept on smiling and praising you for your constraint.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure112;Does [From.GetSheHe] makes any sense? First [From.GetSheHe] weaves all sort of praises around you, on how virtuous and temperate you are, but then suggest it might be good for you to not starve yourself as much as you supposedly do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZZspleasure112;More, I want more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure112;Nothing wrong in indulging a little...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure112;This is disgusting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure112;Enough! The mere thought is making me nauseous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCBspleasure113;Following your [GetFromRelation]'s veiled complaints, you've abandoned all caution and let your appetite grown near insatiable. Every dinner is a feast for you and not too rarely you call your servants during the night to ask for more food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure113; You can barely miss a day without trying something new. Your cravings having been refined as well, you can no longer feel content with the frugal meals you enjoyed before. And yet, [GetFromRelation] cannot fail to berate you for still being dangerously moderate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure113;Every time you indulge during a large feast, you end up with your belly stretched and with a sleepy disposition, yet when you voice your concerns [From.GetFirstName] is ready to harshly rebuke them, telling you it is your deviant mindset to see sickness instead of average health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure113;After [From.GetFirstName]'s frequent veiled insults, you've stopped worrying too much about your meals. After all, if people will complain at you for your moderation and the fasting might be damaging your health, why insist?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure113;With all the shameful quips you're receiving from your [GetFromRelation], you've started to wonder if you really might have been unknowingly depriving yourself too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure113;[From.GetFirstName] is back again with [From.GetHerHis] cheap shots against you, suggesting you might have been in some kind of illness or disgrace to deny yourself even the bare amount of food a person needs to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure113;It's almost laughable how [From.GetFirstName] still is trying to make you feel some sort of shame for your looks, claiming you to be obsessed with your figure to the point of starving yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCEspleasure114;After [From.GetFirstName]'s frequent warnings, you've decided to assume a new diet. After all your health should come before your looks...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure114;After all the times your [GetFromRelation] has yelled and warned you about how dangerous it is for you to keep such a debilitatingly frugal diet, you've started to wonder if you really might have been unknowingly depriving yourself too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure114;[From.GetFirstName] has called you one more time for another harsh scolding over your allegedly absolute lack of judgement, trying to scare you on what the consequences would be for your body if you keep starving yourself as [From.GetSheHe] thinks you do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure114;How dares [From.GetFirstName] treat you like this! Summoning you, reprimanding you for unhealthy diet, as if it was any of [From.GetHerHis] business what do you eat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAspleasure117;[From.GetFirstName]'s concerns seemed suspicious at first, but, looking at yourself in the mirror right now you cannot deny they were founded.

EVTOPTAspleasure117005;A perfect sculpture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure118;You fall back on your chair again, gasping heavily, looking down at the bulging belly peeking from your clothes. [From.GetFirstName]'s influence turned you into a morbid slob, with a chin too many, and soft jiggly arms you can barely raise to put more food in your mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure118;After one last exhausting step, you finally reach your chair and sit down, resting your breasts over your belly. [From.GetFirstName]'s influence turned you into a fat cow, your hips have grown so large and plump you can barely move without setting your legs on fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure118;So tired... need a snack...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure11805;The endless indulging has greatly transformed your [GetFromRelation]: from being such a plain forgettable man, he's now become way more interesting and big.

EVTDESCAspleasure119;You smile faintly, nodding to your servants, so that they can shove another batch of food down your throat. You have no longer the strength to move, nor you wish to.

Keeping on like this, [From.GetSheHe] will get as thin as you wished [From.GetHerHim] to be.  At the beginning [From.GetSheHe] was a little recalcitrant, but now [From.GetSheHe]'s started to develop a healthy paranoia around [From.GetHerHis] weight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure121;Your ceaseless work has certainly resulted in some minor improvement in your [GetFromRelation]'s looks, [From.GetSheHe] has started to skip meals and throw up entire dishes from time to time. You can see the first results of your influence in [From.GetHerHis] hollowed cheeks and shaking hands, but there's still much to go yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure121;Your efforts managed to get [From.GetFirstName] to assume what you would consider a healthier diet, but this will still not do, [From.GetSheHe]'s still too plump, [From.GetSheHe] needs to eat less if [From.GetSheHe] wants to look properly good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure121;Paying some kitchen boys to hide some bile inside your [GetFromRelation]'s stew seems to have been a good idea, at the very least to start triggering some aptly timed nausea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure121;[From.GetFirstName] still completely disregards your just concerns, [From.GetSheHe]'s so disgustingly round, eating like a disgustingly average slob. Going on like this [From.GetSheHe] might actually be getting fatter...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure121;[From.GetFirstName] still completely disregards your just concerns, [From.GetSheHe]'s so disgustingly pudgy, how does [From.GetSheHe] even carries around that bloated body? How does [From.GetSheHe] even live with the shame?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure121;*Flatter [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure121;*Shame [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure121;*Bash [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure122;You cannot remember the last time you felt real hunger, your perceptions of the world have grown soft and distant since [From.GetFirstName]'s honeyed words have helped you defeat your unhealthy eating habits. You often find yourself coming back after fainting, but it's all good to keep your terrific shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure122;With your [GetFromRelation]'s kind guidance, you've reached a point where you barely have any appetite. Sometimes servants remind you when it's time to eat, but more often than not you purposefully miss their call as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure122;[From.GetFirstName]'s insistent suggestions were all that was needed to quell your appetite. You can barely miss a week without throwing up a meal. You know every small roll of fat still plaguing your body and are evermore determined to cleanse them all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure122;Since you've started following [From.GetFirstName]'s counsel regarding your diet, you've surely felt lighter and quicker, receiving all sorts of praise from other courtiers as well. But your [GetFromRelation] still encourages you each break to skip more and more dishes. At the end of the week you're often feeling starved and nervous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure122;After [From.GetFirstName]'s numerous concerned talks, you've started to restrain yourself a little every once in a while. Everyone around you swears it has only done good to your health. You think you're seeing some improvements as well, ignoring the occasional growling from your stomach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure122;With all the concerned praise you're receiving about your eating habits, you're starting to wonder if you shouldn't be a little more strict, if nothing for the sake of your health...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure122;It's the third time you see [From.GetFirstName] slipping something near your plate. At this point it would almost feel more unsettling if [From.GetSheHe] were trying to poison you. Naturally, [From.GetSheHe] kept on smiling and asking if you had enough already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure122;Does [From.GetSheHe] makes any sense? First [From.GetSheHe] weaves all sort of praises around you, on how brave you are, not caring for gossip around you, but then suggest it might be good for you to take on a more frugal diet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZZspleasure122;All good work has good results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure122;I should have more care...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure122;This is terrible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure122;Enough! I won't starve myself to death!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure123;You cannot remember the last time you felt real hunger, your perceptions of the world have grown soft and distant since [From.GetFirstName]'s poisoned words have helped you defeat your unhealthy eating habits. You often find yourself coming back after fainting, but it's all good to keep your terrific shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure123;Following your [GetFromRelation]'s veiled complaints,  you've reached a point where you barely have any appetite. Sometimes servants remind you when it's time to eat, but more often than not you purposefully miss their call as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure123; You can barely miss a week without throwing up a meal. You know every small roll of fat still plaguing your body and so does your [GetFromRelation], whose complaints make you evermore determined to cleanse them all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure123;Every time you skip a meal or throw up one, you end up weakened and with a foggy mind, yet when you voice your concerns [From.GetFirstName] is ready to harshly rebuke them, telling you it is your deviant mindset to see sickness instead of average health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure123;After [From.GetFirstName]'s frequent veiled insults, you've started worrying a lot about your meals. After all, if people complain there must be something wrong, you might be endangering yourself as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure123;With all the shameful quips you're receiving from your [GetFromRelation], you've started to wonder if you really might have been unknowingly indulging yourself too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure123;[From.GetFirstName] is back again with [From.GetHerHis] cheap shots against you, suggesting you might have been starved as a child to develop such a unhealthily robust appetite now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure123;It's almost laughable how [From.GetFirstName] still is trying to make you feel some sort of shame for your looks, claiming your carelessness may very well lead you to disastrous consequences for both your health and your popularity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZZspleasure123;All good work has good results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure123;I should have more care...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCBspleasure124;Following your [GetFromRelation]'s harsh scolding,  you've reached a point where you barely have any appetite. Sometimes servants remind you when it's time to eat, but more often than not you purposefully miss their call as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure124; You can barely miss a week without throwing up a meal. You know every small roll of fat still plaguing your body and so does your [GetFromRelation], whose harsh berating make you evermore determined to cleanse them all. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure124;With your [GetFromRelation] scolding your for eating too much every night, you've started to ask for smaller meals, when not skipping them altogether, yet this new diet often leaves you weakened and nervous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure124;After [From.GetFirstName]'s frequent warnings, you've decided to assume a new diet. After all you should care about keeping a healthy look...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure124;After all the times your [GetFromRelation] has yelled and warned you about how dangerous and shameful it is for you to keep such a debilitatingly indulgent diet, you've started to wonder if you really might have been unknowingly eating too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure124;[From.GetFirstName] has called you one more time for another harsh scolding over your allegedly absolute lack of judgement, trying to scare you on what the consequences would be for your body and your reputation if you keep stuffing yourself as [From.GetSheHe] thinks you do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure124;How dares [From.GetFirstName] treat you like this! Summoning you, reprimanding you for unhealthy diet, as if it was any of [From.GetHerHis] business what do you eat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZZspleasure124;All good work has good results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAspleasure125;[From.GetFirstName] spent quite some time explaining you how [From.GetSheHe]'ll no longer pay attention to your words and your attempts to sway [From.GetHerHim]. Seems clear [From.GetSheHe]'s will not fall for your 'concerns' about [From.GetHerHis] health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure125;But I *am* concerned! Nothing? Fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure127;[From.GetFirstName]'s concerns seemed suspicious at first, but, looking at yourself in the mirror right now you cannot deny they were founded. You feel lighter, look fit and athletic as you never thought possible and have no more trouble walking, let alone breathing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure127;[From.GetFirstName]'s concerns seemed suspicious at first, but, looking at yourself in the mirror right now you cannot deny they were founded. You can finally wrap your hands on your waist without drowning your fingers in rolls of fat and have no real trouble walking up stairs any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure127;Feels good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure12705;Your work has given its fruits: your [GetFromRelation] is finally looking less like a bloated slob and more like a healthy and strong man, one not to to crush horses under his behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure12705;Your work has given its fruits: your [GetFromRelation] has stopped looking like a fat cow and more like a woman someone could find desirable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure127005;A perfect sculpture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure128;You look at your reflection once more, searching for imperfections. There's not many of them any more. With the help of [From.GetFirstName] you've gained a body any mortal would be jealous of. Sure, some may say you look a bit pale and shaky, but it's merely the price for what you've reached.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure128;You toss away another dress, another of your favourite has become too large for you. You have not much use for so-called 'curves' any longer, thanks to [From.GetFirstName]. You're in such a shape to be the envy of all the women in the realm. It needs to be properly admired.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure128;But always be vigilant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure12805;The endless fasting has greatly transformed your [GetFromRelation]: from being such a plain and forgettable man, he's refined his body, tossing away all the rough matter, exalting his true essence. The way he slowly changed, every ounce of flesh removed after the other, the process itself is an artistic masterpiece that you had the luck to witness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure12805;The endless fasting has greatly transformed your [GetFromRelation]: she started slowly, losing inches around her chest and sides, then her face and waist. She's become such a delicate and beautiful flower, ready to be plucked. Her frailty makes her even more precious at your eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure12805;A perfect sculpture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure129;You look faintly at your reflection, ignoring the food laying beneath your bed. It's smell disgusts you, but you have no longer the strength to move. Yet, you look so slim and beautiful now. There's not an ounce of fat in all of your body. You could count your bones, if your mind wasn't clouded by the deprivation [From.GetFirstName] persuaded you into.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAspleasure12905;Why did you ever doubt yourself? You thought [From.GetFirstName] could never grow smaller than he already was, but you underestimated your skills and his determination. What a delicate thing he has become, almost a different creature, an otherworldly being which walks alongside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAspleasure130;Your [GetFromRelation]'s concerns seems to be really with your behaviour.

EVTOPTBspleasure130;That's sick!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure131;[From.GetFirstName] has really become insatiable, trying new games and new players nearly every night, exploring new uncharted heights in pleasure and pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure131;[From.GetFirstName] fully understands the game and, although [From.GetSheHe] has yet to master it, [From.GetSheHe]'s grown knowledgeable enough to tire even yourself. You can finally run wild with your imagination on [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure131;You can finally enjoy [From.GetFirstName]'s full attentions, while helping [From.GetHerHim] finding more friends to spend the night with and new toys and games to play with. It might be the good time to push for something more extreme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure131;You think your influence is finally catching on with [From.GetFirstName]. There's still a long way to go, but [From.GetSheHe] doesn't seem repulsed by your ideas as before. If nothing else, you've sparkled [From.GetHerHis] curiosity, maybe even actual interest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCFspleasure131;[From.GetFirstName] is still persisting in [From.GetHerHis] prudish attitude. What charm could possibly erode such a stubborn fool and let [From.GetHerHim] understand the true joys of passion?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure131;[From.GetFirstName] still remain the most virtuous and intransigent of the people you know. It seems like [From.GetSheHe] think of [From.GetHerHis] integrity as a badge of honour [From.GetSheHe] doesn't want to lose, rather than a shackle to be discarded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure131;[From.GetFirstName] still remain the most virtuous and intransigent of the people you know. Why does [From.GetSheHe] even care so much about a part of [From.GetHerHis] body which apparently [From.GetSheHe] never even use?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAspleasure132;The fires of lust blazing within your soul could ignite a forest, there seems to be nothing that can sate your cravings.

EVTDESCBspleasure132;Only a few people understand there is a point where pain and pleasure meet, the dull masses dismiss such claims out of fear and ignorance. But not you. Your nights spent with [From.GetFirstName] opened your eyes more than they ever were. Along with other things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure132;Now that [From.GetFirstName] showed you this new world, you crave to go deeper. You often find yourself letting your mind go adrift during your waking hours, thinking of strange and exciting new ways you could spend the night. And of who else you'd want to share it with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure132;You failed to be strong, but just for a night. [From.GetFirstName] had been so kind to you lately, and [From.GetHerHis] promises looked so alluring...

EVTDESCEspleasure132;[From.GetFirstName] has been so nice with you lately, regaling you with improbable tales of [From.GetHerHis] exploits, jokingly wondering where you could gain some to tell [From.GetHerHim] in return.

EVTDESCBspleasure133;This whirlwind of lust, plots and betrayals is something wonderful, a great gift from [From.GetFirstName]. It's such an exciting and dangerous life, every second of every day. And when one of the two prevails, such marvels are done upon the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure133;Another poisoned drink and you wake in [From.GetFirstName]'s dungeon. It doesn't bother you that much any more. Keeping your guard up, concocting some ploy yourself, seeing who will fall first, it's an exciting foreplay of its own kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure133;You could not prevent yourself from falling to your [GetFromRelation]'s trick, and when you woke up you were bound and naked in the grass, far away in the wilderness.

EVTDESCEspleasure133;[From.GetFirstName] has given you a lot of attention lately, asking strange things, inviting you to seemingly harmless trips and so on.

EVTDESCBspleasure134;Savagery and passion entwined in the last days as you and [From.GetFirstName] explore new depths. You're no longer content waiting [From.GetHerHim], sometimes it is you know to prepare the ambush, sometimes not even against [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure134;An ambush in the bedroom is a good starting thrill, but can become dull when repeated to time. Fortunately [From.GetFirstName] knows this.

EVTOPTAsnehekharan19;We can spare something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan19;Get lost, you filthy beggars!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan21;For weeks you've received complaints from your subjects regarding the undead troops roaming across your lands on your liege's command. There has been no attack, but the people are unsettled by the skeletons standing sometimes for days, staring at their homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan21;I'll talk with their master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan21;Just pretend they're not there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan22;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent a complaint about your troops. Apparently the glorious armies of Nehekhara stationed to protect [From.GetHerHis] province are unsettling the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan22;I command them to fall back and change their path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan22;I command them to reassure the locals of their good intentions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsnehekharan22;This is no concern of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan23;Luckily [From.GetTitledFirstName] seems to understand the problem and has had [From.GetHerHis] undead troops discretely fall back, pursuing less exposed patrols, hopefully placating the fears of the living.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan23;Good to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan23005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent an envoy to thank you for your wisdom regarding the issue of your troops scaring [From.GetHerHis] subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan23005;I still don't see what was scary about them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan24;Unfortunately, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has ruled otherwise on your plea to retreat some of the undead from your countryside. In fact, there are now frequent reports of people scared away from the province by skeletons trying to speak with them in hissing voices and dead languages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan24;What are they doing?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan24005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] is still unsatisfied with your solution to the problem of the craven subjects in [From.GetHerHis] provinces. The living keep on mistrusting and shying away, despite your servants' attempts at reassuring them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan24005;Are they hiding something?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan25;You thought the worst when receiving news of the undead approaching directly your subjects, but, astonishingly enough, your people managed to find common ground with the creatures and are starting to get along fine with each other, trusting the immortal soldiers to be ever-watchful over their land and possessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan25;Who'd have thought?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan25005;Just as you assumed, it was only a question of showing the integrity and discipline of Nehekharan troops to reassure the people under [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan25005;It's obvious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan26;The response of [From.GetTitledFirstName] was the same as that of [From.GetHerHis] soldier: silence. You keep on receiving complaints about your subjects, but there's not really much you can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan26;Why they have to be so creepy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan26005;Your vassal finally stopped with [From.GetHerHis] meaningless complaints about your soldiers scaring the local populace. After all, if they've done nothing wrong, what do they have to fear about?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan26005;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan27;Since you can remember you've heard incredible and terrible stories about your liege lord and the palace of immortal corpses they live in. Now that there's an opportunity to travel there, you're not sure you want to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan27;I'm not scared!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan27;Maybe when I'm older...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan28;Amongst the visitors from the lands of the living under your rule, you've been surprised to see a strange creature. Although covered in flesh, it is smaller than any being you remember, be it human, dwarf or halfling, with short limbs and big eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan28;I shall speak with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan28;A creature so small has to be meaningless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan29;The tall and dessicated undead, wrapped in golden robes, is finally in front of you and starts speaking in a strange and hissing voice, despite [From.GetHerHis] mouth hanging still. The creature leans forward, as if [From.GetSheHe] was about to grab you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan29;H-Hello! How do you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan29;*Fight back!*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsnehekharan29;*Flee*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan30;Not only you discovered to your surprise that the creature is in fact your vassal, [From.GetSheHe] explained you that [From.GetSheHe] is a child, that's why [From.GetSheHe] is so small. That still sounds strange, you don't remember ever being like that, even when alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan30;At least [From.GetSheHe] can talk properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan30005;In the end the undead just wanted to talk with you, [From.GetSheHe] didn't mean any harm and looked just surprised to know you are a kid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan30005;Just for now, though!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan31;The creature was more dangerous than you realized. When you tried to approach it and see what it was, it screamed something and attacked you, shortly after running away with one of your sacred ribs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan31;Come back here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan31005;The undead guards are still looking for you, but you think they'll be more busy recovering the trophy you snatched from [From.GetHerHis] ribcage to worry about you getting out of this tomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan31005;I still showed [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan32;At your very sight the little creature started twitching and, before you could even say something, it was running away, screaming with an high-pitched voice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan32;What the...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan32005;Luckily, you managed to save yourself from the evil undead before it could suck your soul. You'll never return to this cursed tomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan32005;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan33;Don't know why, maybe because of the lack of eyes, but the undead lord has ignored you for all the time you've been in [From.GetHerHis] palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan33;Maybe it's for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan34;You've suffered a great shortage of water this year, with many oasis running low or dry. You've tried to plead to your undead overlords, but they've been silent for the most part.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan34;I'll ask directly to my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan34;It's no use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan35;You've received word from one of your Nehekkan vassals. [From.GetTitledFirstName] for some strange reason is asking for a great deal of water for [From.GetHerHim]self and [From.GetHerHis] subjects. You do remember water had no flavour for the living either, so you're not sure why [From.GetSheHe] would need any...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan35;If they want to damp themselves, let them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan35;This is nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan36;Fortunately your liege has seen the desperate needs of your tribe and has sent some of [From.GetHerHis] servants to gather water for your subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan36;The gods be praised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan36005;Unfortunately your liege has been as silent as [From.GetHerHis] servants and refused to give any help in the search for water.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan36005;We'll find something eventually...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan37;You remember enjoying being at a table with friends, partaking in the fruits of the land, when you were alive. Yet all food tastes like ash and all wine like sand. There's no pleasure in feasting and no joy in conversation. Your servants are silent and empty, your lords envious pretenders of past and future generations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan37;I hate this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan37;This is just too sad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsnehekharan38;You still have some memories of the days when you were alive, the anger, the passion... Yet all is still and cold now.

EVTDESCAsnehekharan40;For some weeks now the pretender you decided to rule along with has started making some strange pressures.

EVTDESC_MUTATION_1002;The Chaos Gods have twisted and stretched your body to its limit, to the point you can barely recognize yourself any more. The many mutations have turned you into a horrific display of horns, scales and unnatural appendages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1002A;Grlblgh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1003;More and more mutations have reshaped your body, turning you into a monstrous being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1003A;Not entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1004;The Chaos Gods have undoubtedly touched you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1004A;It's true...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1006;The voices never shut up, sometimes reality changes before you in a blink of an eye: friend turns to foe, night to day. Is there anything at all real?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1006A;Blreagh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1007;Sometimes you just think all reality is part of a dream. And you are the dreamer. Those poor fools, not understanding they're just figments of your imagination...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1007A;Ah, idiots!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1008;People sometimes look at you strangely, as if they were hiding something, but they never give you a straight answer if you inquire about them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1008A;People are strange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1009;You've long followed the gods, trusted in their blessing and kept on honouring them in your every action, yet their gaze has not touched you, you've not received their gifts and have been left, with the voices in your head tormenting and berating you. The gods cursed and left you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1009A;Nooorrrgh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1010;You cannot stand it any more: the powers of Chaos running through your body can no longer be contained by your will. With a shrieking sound your flesh twists and rips open as you turn into a mindless abomination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1010A;AAArglrluablhjggghhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1011;Your existence of continued torment and hate as finally come to an end: whatever is left of your body collapses, completely ripped into shreds by the stuff of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1011A;Gblurrggrhasghhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_20005;You feel a itch on your nose, but when you raise your hand to scratch it, you find yourself grasping at a growing hard beak, quickly taking it's place over your whole face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_20006;You awoke with a sense of choking. You gasped, searching for air, but something large and wet is blocking your mouth. It takes some time to realize it is your very tongue, overgrown and extended to unnatural proportions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_20007;Your teeth fall one after another. In their place long and rotten fangs sprout, until you can barely speak coherently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_20008;More and more eyes open on your face, then your neck and, after that, your whole body is covered by blinking appendages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_20009;Something it's irritating your eyes, but the more you scratch them, the more they burn. When you finally find peace, you realize your eyes have turned into bulging reptile-like things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy2;What was that shadow? You could have sworn you heard someone whispering behind your back. Why would someone follow you in the first place?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy2;A plot?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy3;People suffer all the time, but why care? As long as you are alright, there's nothing to be sad about. In fact, how could you consider yourself well-being, if not by comparison with those who are not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy3;Their suffering makes me feel better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy4;All this stress plaguing your mind is just too much. You need something to calm yourself, anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy4;Some herbs might help, maybe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy5;Incompetent narrow-minded fools might play safe with magic, but you know better by now: one cannot truly master the Winds without taking a few risks. This last experiment might really help you better understanding the arcane.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy5;Let's start now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy6;As you expected, the experiment was successful. Each day your mind opens more to the great secrets of the universe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy6;I must know more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy7;You spent an entire night of work for nothing: the secret of this spell still eludes you. All the time wasted for a failure is driving you mad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy7;I need to start again! I must know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy8;Collateral damage is inevitable when fighting for control over the great powers of the universe. You just hoped the fire wouldn't spread to yourself as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy8;Aaargh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy9;This is the last time you have to wake up with a damning headache without remembering what you did the previous night. Alcohol is poison and you shall not submit your brilliant mind to it ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy9;I've better things to think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy10;Nobody is truly ever evil, the more you think about it. All people have good reasons for their actions and those who are said to be wicked are just sad and lonely being, who were probably abused when young. Why should you add to their misery by branding them as villains?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy10;There is no evil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy11;You've always known to be special, but you are certain now that the Winds of Magic flow through you, granting you powers that mere mortals only dream of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy11;I'm a powerful mage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy12;Most people don't see it, but in the end isn't life one big joke? You can see it now, it might be you just have keener senses or maybe you're the protagonist of this farce. Why else would other people not see the hilarity in murder or the humour in misery?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy12;Ah ah ah ah ah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy13;For sometime now hardly anything has been able to trigger a response for you. As time passes by not only you do not feel any passion left for your loved ones nor hatred for your enemies, your very skin has started to lose any perception.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy13;I feel... nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy14;Life is something miraculous, when you take one, you can feel all of the vibrant passions and dreams of a dying soul. It lasts but a moment, it's never enough to sate your thirst for death. And off you go, searching for the next target.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy14;The blood calls...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy15;People have always had to look up on you, they know you're better than them in every way and so do you. Are you even one of them, you wonder? Perhaps you are something more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy15;...more than a mortal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy16;You couldn't help it, it was such a beautiful scene... The body moves now, but soon your blade shall turn it into a motionless puppet and shall be able to watch as the soul passes away into the Realm beyond...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy16;Soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy18;The crazed [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has viciously killed your [GetFromRelation]. Rumours say the horrible murder was entirely without motive but the killer's sick pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy18;Madness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy19;A single soul is not enough to satisfy you tonight: the will of the Great Reaper pervades you and within a week you've left a trail of blood and mangled corpses all over your lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy19;Pile the bodies, create a canal with their blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy20;A single soul is not enough to satisfy you tonight: the will of the Great Reaper pervades you, you summon the Winds of Magic at your fingertips and with a few words an entire building explodes, dragging into oblivion countless lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy20;Kaboom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy21;The crazed [From.GetFirstName] has employed [From.GetHerHis] terrible magic to blow up a building in [From.GetHerHis] own lands, killing many of [From.GetHerHis] subjects in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy21;Madness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy22;Why should the thief be hanged when he only stole out of hunger? Is it his fault if he was born poor? Why should the murderer die? Wouldn't that make the executioner a murderer as well?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy22;Nobody should get punished, ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy23;There was a time when you revelled in other people's suffering, but, the more you look back at those days, the more you feel as if those people only deserved your pity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy23;Those poor souls...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy24;You just visited your dungeons and saw a prisoner laying, chained on the wall. Why should anybody suffer like that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy24;You'll be freed at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy25;With real power running through your veins you finally realize how deluded you were: only *now* you are a real mage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy25;This is amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy26;Even the most powerful wizards make mistakes from time to time. You were sure the potion would react well to your spell, but something might have gone wrong and the philtre just exploded into your face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy26;Ouch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy28;That disturbing smirk, it unsettles you. [From.GetFirstName] has spent a good chunk of [From.GetHerHis] day mocking you and laughing, claiming your mind has turned into mush and you're no longer good for anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy28;This is the third time this week [From.GetFirstName] mocks and trips you, [From.GetSheHe] thinks the ailment affecting your body is something hilarious, the cynical freak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslunacy28;You still have the laughter of [From.GetFirstName] echoing within your mind alongside that maniac's cruel quips on your painful disfigurement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDslunacy28;[From.GetFirstName] decided to spend [From.GetHerHis] morning chuckling behind you, poking at your sides and making fun of your generous figure, one shaming snark after the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEslunacy28;[From.GetFirstName] decided to spend [From.GetHerHis] morning chuckling behind you, obviously pretending to be concerned about your frail health, not sparing jokes about you being skinnier than a shadow, barely capable of walking two steps without crumbling for exhaustion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFslunacy28;This is the third time this week [From.GetFirstName] mocks and trips you, [From.GetSheHe] thinks the illness weakening your body and plaguing your mind is something hilarious, the cynical freak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGslunacy28;Has [From.GetFirstName] no heart at all? Your pregnancy is a nightmare as it is without [From.GetHerHim] making fun at you with [From.GetHerHis] cruel jokes, patting your womb and scaring you with all the possible ways your labour could go wrong for both mother and child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHslunacy28;As if it wasn't enough trouble for you as it is, [From.GetFirstName] spent last evening cracking jokes about the corruption which is devouring your body, as if your mutations were a light topic of no real importance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIslunacy28;What goes [From.GetFirstName]'s mind? The disturbed freak spent all day pointing and laughing at you as if *you* were the insane maniac in the room, rather than [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy28;Enough! Stop it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy29;Watching that miserable fool [From.GetFirstName] trying to get back at you is almost as hilarious as [From.GetHerHis] irredeemably broken mind. You can't stop to chuckle at the thought of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy29;All broken and sore, [From.GetFirstName] is such an easy target. The way [From.GetSheHe] walks, or tries to, it's the most humorous thing you saw in the week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslunacy29;Rarely one has the benefit of entertaining himself with such a fantastic opportunity as [From.GetFirstName]'s mangled body. Tearing scabs off [From.GetHerHis] scourged skin it's just the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDslunacy29;How can so few laugh at [From.GetFirstName]? A land whale such as [From.GetSheHe] is, slobbering over the palace all sweaty and bloated... It just calls to be pranked upon, yet people still think you are at fault, for some reason...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEslunacy29;How can so few laugh at [From.GetFirstName]? That frail little thing, with [From.GetHerHis] skin barely covering [From.GetHerHis] bones... It just calls to be pranked upon, yet people still think you are at fault, for some reason...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFslunacy29;Making fun of an ill person like [From.GetFirstName] has double the fun: not only you have to think of new quips to make at [From.GetHerHim], you have to keep a safe distance to avoid sharing [From.GetHerHis] state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGslunacy29;Why do other people have to always treat pregnant women with such care, as if they were something precious. Making fun at [From.GetFirstName] swollen body and sickly disposition gave you the best time of this month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHslunacy29;Small imperfections are already quite enough a cause for mocking, but a full blown third eye or fifth limb? [From.GetFirstName] just called for it. If [From.GetSheHe] didn't want to be made fun of, [From.GetSheHe] shouldn't have gotten the Dark Gods' attention, it's just that simple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIslunacy29;[From.GetFirstName] is as crazy as it goes. There's barely any point in mocking [From.GetHerHim], in the end. What else can you say that everybody hasn't thought of already? Still, that does make it quite a challenge to tackle...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy29;AH AH AH AH AH AH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy30;What do you have to fear any more? No word or action can make you cry, no wound can inflame your mind with pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy30;Nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy31;Even if somebody was conspiring against you, what would be the result? A dagger through your heart feel less than the morning's air to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy31;I don't care any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy32;You're just so desperate to *feel* something. You thought a blade could pierce deep enough to trigger some response, but, despite your efforts and all the blood spilled, no pain reached your mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy32;Is there any point in closing these wounds?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy33;You are marvellous and powerful god, it is time that your people started to treat you as such. They have to bow down and worship you, build statues in your honour, pray for you to judge mercifully their souls once they're dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy33;You are beautiful and powerful goddess, it is time that your people started to treat you as such. They have to bow down and worship you, build statues in your honour, pray for you to judge mercifully their souls once they're be dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy33;Bow before me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy34;Sigmar might have ascended in the long past, after he left this world, but you are a god now, divine blood ruling over this lands. Why should you bow down to one who is your equal, if not inferior to your might?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy34;The gods rule from afar, rarely ever talking to their followers, all the gods except you. Your worshippers can see you, they can hear your terrible voice and heed to your commands. Why should you bow down to those who are your equals, if not inferior to your might?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy34;I am your Lord and Master!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy35;What even is love? You do not remember any more, nor you feel any passion left for those who claim to love you in return. There's no point in keeping such a charade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy35;I do not love you, nor anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy35005;So far has [From.GetFirstName] descended into madness that [From.GetSheHe] has entirely forgotten what it means to love and be loved. Now [From.GetSheHe] feels nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy35005;The one I loved is dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy36;All the anger, all the hatred, they're gone. In the past the mere name of this person would have inflamed your heart, but now, it is not even worth of your attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy36;I have neither enemies nor friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy36005;[From.GetFirstName] has been your rival for a long time, but now the affliction plaguing [From.GetHerHis] mind has wiped away any of [From.GetHerHis] emotion towards you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy36005;I still don't like [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy37;You've had friends in your life, but now the boundaries of camaraderie have been dissolved. You do not feel like you share anything with this person any more, nor the past experiences mean anything to you any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy37;You are no longer my friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy37005;There was a time when you enjoyed [From.GetFirstName]'s company, but now [From.GetSheHe] has grown cold and detached. There's no friendship or interest left within [From.GetHerHis] mind for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy37005;It was good while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsuccghrond14;With the death of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] the Druchii Sorceresses of Ghrond have elected another to lead their cabal: [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsuccghrond14;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsuccghrond3;The Sorceresses of Ghrond seem to be mostly approving of [From.GetTitledFirstName]. While not a certainty, [From.GetSheHe] may well be the next to rule over the cabal of Ghrond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsuccghrond3;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsuccghrond4;The dreaded black tower of Ghrond has been home of Druchii Sorceresses for millennia. The old elven hags study magic and plot for power within its walls. It's unlikely for a Druchii to rule over them without their approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsuccghrond4;Hmpf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1202;Are the creatures tearing reality and coming into your world, or are they a figment of your own imagination, created by the substances running through your veins? In either case, their mere sight is too horrifying to handle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1202;AAAAHH!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1203;When you lay down, your mind filled with the strangest stuff, you ponder over the mysteries of the universe. It is amazing what a new perspective can do to widen a person's mindset.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1203;The music... of the universe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1204;A thousand enemies hide behind your very shadow. Every time you enhance your senses you can almost see them, lurking outside of reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1204;We must be prepared!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1205;Taking a few spoonful of dust is just what you need to calm yourself and let all the worries of the world pass away as your mind is populated by the strangest things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1205;Hello, guys!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1206;You must have more stuff, your reserves have been almost entirely depleted, but the supplier is having a hard time finding any new batch this year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1206;I don't care how much it costs! Just find more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1206;The waiting is killing me!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1207;It has been sometime since beer and wine lost much of their appeal to you. They all taste stale and you cannot bear the headache coming after each drinking night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1207;I've better things to consume...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1208;Is this even a life? Waiting from one dose to the other, unable to relish any event without your mind being clouded by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1208;No more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1208;I can't... stop it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos1;You could have sworn you had a holding in [Root.GetName], but there's nothing left. As you wonder what could have happened, you see the fortress flying over your head with wings of stone and disappearing in the the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos1;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos2;A servant comes running at you, screaming the ground has turned into a giant mouth and started taking bites off one of your buildings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos2;That... is expected?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos3;A band of Kurgan has come from afar to pledge its allegiance to you, hoping to share in your glory and the favour of the Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos3;Welcome, comrades!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos4;You wake up to see a giant blinking eye staring back at you, mounted on a pair of hairy human legs. When you flinch, the creature jumps off your bed and runs off with a squeaking sound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos4;What the...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos5;The influence of Chaos is strong in the province of [Root.GetName]. The great portal is attracting everything towards it and things have started to fall up, rather than down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos5;Hold tight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos6;An indescribable vortex of horror and insanity has opened in the province of [Root.GetName], dragging people and beasts inside to the Realm of Chaos and spewing forth crazed daemons and eldritch beings of horrific might and intent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos6;Run for your lives!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos8;The great warp rift in [Root.GetName] has swallowed a great deal of troops battling in that land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAschaos9;Ugh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos10;Within a few days an unearthly beautiful garden, filled with fruits and intoxicating rivers of mead has grown in these lands bringing pleasure and luxury to its inhabitants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos10;Where...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos11;All the rivers and wells in these lands have turned red, their water transformed into blood. It's mere taste seems enough to send even the most peaceful man into a frenzy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos11;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos12;Shadows in these lands have stopped following their owners. In fact, they are starting to talk and congregate and many swear they are plotting to kill their masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCmagicpotentialA3;As time passes, you still feel the twinging of magic, it's very distant, probably you wouldn't understand what it was if your people didn't know so much about it, but it's still there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialB3;As time passes, you still feel the twinging of magic, it's very distant, probably you wouldn't understand what it was if your people didn't know so much about it, but it's still there.

EVTDESCmagicpotentialC3;As time passes, it seems clear now you are clearly a wizard in the making: since your childhood you've felt the Winds of Magic and instinctively tried to influence their flow. If only you found a teacher;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialD3;When your eyes are closed you can still see the Winds of Magic flowing through the world. Such is your potential in magic that you've already managed to warp reality through your will a couple of times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential3;I must know more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialA3005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has shown some crude predisposition in the arcane matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialB3005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has shown some basic predisposition in the arcane matters and, if taught well, could become a talented wizard one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCmagicpotentialD3005;Rarely was seen a natural in the ways of magic like your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. With a proper training [From.GetSheHe] could easily become one of the greatest magic users of your time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential3005;Something to ponder about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialA4;Luckly the strange sensation is nothing but a far away twitching at the border of your consciousness. You've hidden it, isolated it... You know that it's bad news and you must keep it under wraps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialB4;Luckly the strange sensation is nothing but a far away twitching at the border of your consciousness. You've hidden it, isolated it... You know that it's bad news and you must keep it under wraps. When magic is concerned, it's better to keep quiet about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialC4;Since your childhood you've felt the Winds of Magic and instinctively tried to influence their flow.

EVTDESCmagicpotentialD4;Even when your eyes are closed you can still see the Winds of Magic flowing through the world.

EVTOPTAmagicpotential4;Why me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialA5;Luckly the strange sensation is nothing but a far away twitching at the border of your consciousness. You've hidden it, isolated it... You know that it's bad news and you must keep it under wraps from the courtiers and, most of all, your liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

You've thus decided to keep your potential hidden from the courtiers and, most of all, your liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialD5;Even when your eyes are closed you can still see the Winds of Magic flowing through the world. Such is your potential in magic that you've already managed to warp reality through your will a couple of times. You can barely help yourself to not do it, but you must. You fear what would happen to you if your secret was to be discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential5;Why me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialA6;Your predisposition to magic was barely even something you had realized about yourself, yet your liege had much keener eyes on the matter and was quick to expose you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialB6;Your predisposition to magic was barely even something you had realized about yourself, yet your liege had much keener eyes on the matter and was quick to expose you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialC6;Since your childhood you feared your predisposition to magic would have betrayed you someday. And today that day has come: your liege has found out about your gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialD6;Since your childhood you feared your predisposition to magic would have betrayed you someday. And today that day has come: your liege has found out about your gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential6;Wait! I can explain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialA6005;It was hard to spot, but you are certain now your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has some faint connection with the Winds of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialB6005;It was hard to spot, but you are certain now your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has some connection with the Winds of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialC6005;How could it have passed unnoticed for all these years? Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has clearly a strong connection to the Winds of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialD6005;How could it have passed unnoticed for all these years? Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has clearly a strong connection to the Winds of Magic. So strong could [From.GetHerHis] powers grow, if left unchecked...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential6005;Burn [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBmagicpotential6005;He might be the Chosen One! Kill him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCmagicpotential6005;This is not a concern of mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBmagicpotential4;I don't care! I won't hide who I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotential7;You think you've discovered sound proof of witchcraft perpetrated in the county you're hunting in. It is time to confront the perpetrator of these foul and diabolic rituals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential7;I will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotential8;The Witch Hunter [From.GetFirstName] has come to you, accusing you of worshipping the Ruinous Powers and drawing from the nefarious Winds of Magic to perform dark deeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential8;*Appeal to liege*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBmagicpotential8;*Banish the Witch Hunter*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCmagicpotential8;*Imprison the Witch Hunter*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotential9;The Witch Hunter [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has accused your [GetFromRelation] -[From.GetTitledFirstName] of meddling with the forbidden lore and casting evil spells in [From.GetHerHis] private time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential9;Burn [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBmagicpotential9;I shall be merciful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCmagicpotential9;You shall be thrown in the darkest dungeon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotential10;You've finally been discovered for what you are. The Witch Hunters have found out about your dark tidings and your forbidden knowledge and have sieged your palace by surprise, with the help of your liege, to drag you on the stake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential10;I curse you ALL!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WITCH_WITCH;Witch!! Witch!! Witch!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotential11;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was burned at the stake on charges of witchcraft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential11;I don't care about these things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBmagicpotential11;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_druchiiinv.18;You've discovered another amongst your servants, [From.GetTitledFirstName], who thought he could secretely practice the dark arts to grow more powerful than you and kill you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_druchiiinv.18;There is no doubt about it: your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] shows the gift of a sorcerer-to-be. Why else would he have hid this from you if not to plot against your throne?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv.18;I shall not die by your sorcery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBdruchiiinv.18;The prophecy must not be fulfilled. Not even by you, my son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_druchiiinv.19;The Witch-King discovered of your meddling with the dark arts and has quickly sent his best assassins to deal with you. Before you can even react, the shadowy druchii sink their blades in your back time and again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv.19;Hhhggghhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos17;[From.GetFirstName] is dragged and bound at the centre of the summoning circle while you start chanting the spell. What daemon should you call forth from the Warp to inhabit [From.GetHerHis] body and devour [From.GetHerHis] soul?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos17;I call forth a Flamer of Tzeentch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos17;I call forth a Plaguebearer of Nurgle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos17;I call forth a Daemonette of Slaanesh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos17;I call forth a Bloodletter of Khorne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos17005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual, but at the last moment you manage to break free of your boundaries and interrupt the ritual. In the backlash of magical fires, you sneak out of the room, fleeing from your captor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos17005;That was close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos17006;Just a few words before the ritual is complete, [From.GetFirstName] manages to get free of [From.GetHerHis] boundaries, interrupting the ritual. Even worse, the backlash of the broken spell creates enough of a distraction to allow the prisoner to escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos17006;Gahhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos18;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual, but after the spell has been completed, something seem to go wrong. You feel something crawling inside you, but your body cannot handle the stress and you explode all over the room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos18;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos18005;It would seem the recipient was not appropriate. The spell somehow fails and the prisoner explodes into a bloody pulp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos18005;Just... fetch me some new clothes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos19;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos19;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos19005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts twisting and burning as the Flamer reshapes it in a cacophony of discordant voices and writhing colours. Yet, something went wrong with the wards. The daemon slips away right after inhabiting the body, free to roam the world unbound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos19005;Curses! So close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos20;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos20;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos20005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts twisting and burning as the Flamer reshapes it in a cacophony of discordant voices and writhing colours. The wards bound the creature, who awaits for your commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos20005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos21;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos21;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos21005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts bloating and decaying as the Plaguebearer reshapes it in a flurry of rupturing boils and swarming vermin. Yet, something went wrong with the wards. The daemon slips away right after inhabiting the body, free to roam the world unbound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos21005;Curses! So close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos22;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual.

EVTOPTAschaos22005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos23;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos23;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos23005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts writhing and twisting as the Daemonette reshapes it in a storm of flesh and desire. Yet, something went wrong with the wards. The daemon slips away right after inhabiting the body, free to roam the world unbound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos23005;Curses! So close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos24;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual.

EVTDESCschaos24005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts writhing and twisting as the Daemonette reshapes it in a storm of flesh and desire. The wards bound the creature, who awaits for your commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos24005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos25;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos25;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos25005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts tearing itself apart as the Bloodletter reshapes it in a wave of bone and blood. Yet, something went wrong with the wards. The daemon slips away right after inhabiting the body, free to roam the world unbound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos25005;Curses! So close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos26;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos26;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos26005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts tearing itself apart as the Bloodletter reshapes it in a wave of bone and blood. The wards bound the creature, who awaits for your commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos26005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos27;You've prepared the summoning circle and all the needed materials to temporarily open a portal to the Warp and summon a daemon into this world. Which creature should you call?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos27;I call forth a Flamer of Tzeentch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos27;I call forth a Plaguebearer of Nurgle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos27;I call forth a Daemonette of Slaanesh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos27;I call forth a Bloodletter of Khorne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos27;I call forth a K'daai of Hashut!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos28;Despite your best efforts, the circle was not strong enough to contain the eldritch energies of the Chaos Realm. The Warp breaks through and a host of cavorting daemons drags you with them to meet their masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos28;Noooooo!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos29;The Flamer slowly takes form before you, a collection of mouths and gooey limbs spitting fire and steaming ichor. The circle holds and the daemon is yours to command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos29;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos30;The Plaguebearer slowly takes form before you, a humanoid creature with rotten skin, skinny limbs and a bloated belly filled with worms and decayed entrails. The circle holds and the daemon is yours to command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos30;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos31;The Daemonette slowly takes form before you, an alluring androgynous creature with pale, silken skin bounded by hard chitin. The circle holds and the daemon is yours to command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos31;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos32;The Bloodletter slowly takes form before you, a screaming red-skinned monster eager for battle.  The circle holds and the daemon is yours to command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos32;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos33;There's a creature of one of my Master's enemies in this land. I cannot tolerate it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos33;Die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos34;We are many and our Master is one. It's time to drag the wizard to our home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos34;Yessss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos35;In your pride you thought the host of daemons in your service would be easy to control. But you were wrong: the creature of the Warp have banded against you and, easily overcoming your powers, they drag you screaming into the Realm of the Dark Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos35;Noooooo!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos38;A ravenous Bloodletter of Khorne has come to you, offering you promises of future conquests and victories and standing ready to do your bidding. Or so it says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBschaos38;A decayed Plaguebearer of Nurgle has come to you, offering its eternal love and plenty of gifts from its Dark Master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCschaos38;A luscious Daemonette of Slaanesh has come to you, offering you to lead you through uncharted heights of pleasure and joy. Or so she claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDschaos38;A raving Flamer of Tzeentch has come to you, offering you the power of the endless fires of the Changer of Ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEschaos38;A searing K'daai of Hashut has come to you, offering you the might and riches of the Bullfather's forges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos38;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos38;I don't need you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DEMON_HUNT;Daemon Hunt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos40;There is a nefarious presence plaguing this province. A daemonic being might be at work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos40;It won't hide for longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos42;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has tracked down a daemon hiding in your lands. The Witch Hunter is certain of the existence of the creature and requires your support to trap and cleanse it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos42;Yes, destroy it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos42;We have other things to worry about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos43;You've received support from your liege and are ready to spring the trap on the daemon and cleanse the land from its evil influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos43;Let us proceed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos44;The creature of Chaos revealed itself to be stronger than the Witch Hunter's faith. [From.GetFirstName]'s remains were found scattered in the main square, alongside the entrails of the soldiers you provided [From.GetHerHim] with. There is no trace of the beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos44;The gods protect us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos45;A nosy Witch Hunter has managed to find out about your familiar. The daemon revealed itself to be more cunning than [From.GetHerHim] and managed to kill [From.GetHerHim], but it was also put on the run, rescinding the contract which was binding it to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos45;Damnations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos46;The accursed mortals have managed to trap you. You fight for as long as you can, but the Witch Hunters are finally able to send you screaming back to the Chaos Realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos46;Grreeaaaahhhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos47;An accursed Witch Hunter, [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has managed to trap and destroy your familiar. Luckly for now, the connection between the two of you remains hidden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos47;Damnations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos48;After the cleansing of the daemon, you've spent a lot of time trying to figure out who the wicked creature of darkness was serving and you've finally concluded it must have been [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos48;No one can escape the righteous wrath of Sigmar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos49;"The Witch Hunter [From.GetFirstName] has managed to rally some ridiculous sort of ""proof"" regarding you consorting with daemons and demands now your confession.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos49;*Appeal to liege*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos49;*Banish the Witch Hunter*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos49;*Imprison the Witch Hunter*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos50;[From.GetTitledFirstName] stands accused, by [FromFrom.GetFirstName], on charges of consorting with daemons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos50;Burn [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos50;This is just posturing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos50;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in the darkest dungeon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos51005;Papa Nurgle has brought forth good tidings and plentiful bounties for all the good people in the world. Today its servant has decided to honour you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos51005;Ugh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos53;[From.GetFirstName] craves to see what your worth is or spill your blood for Khorne. Would you accept the daemon's challenge and fight with it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos53;Let's fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos53;You're beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos54;The fight goes on until the daemon is prone on the ground, leaking ichor from numerous wounds. You're tired, but you've learned something more about battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos54;This is your place, vermin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos55;You try your best, but nobody ends the fight as victor. Even worse, the Bloodletter manages to sink its claws deep in your flesh a couple of times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos55;Grrnnhhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos56;Despite your efforts, the daemon swiftly overcomes your defences and tears your body apart, leaving you near-dead on the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos56;Gllfgrrnnthh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos57;You push the daemon back time and again and such is your display of violence that you feel the gaze of Khorne bearing upon you, granting your body new strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos57;Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos59;[From.GetFirstName] awaits you inside your rooms. The daemonette lures you in your bed, whispering honeyed words and promising you to unravel secrets from beyond the veil, if only you'd let her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos59;Yes, please!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos59;Maybe another time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos60;The lips of the daemon feel cold at the first kiss, but they quickly gain an exotic and irresistible flavour. And at every new taste of her, you feel as if your mind is opening to new horizons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos60;More, more!...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos60;Enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos61;The whispers within your mind are getting louder. There is no doubt something else has found home within your body and is now struggling to wrestle its control from you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos61;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos63;Your blood boils to the point of burning your flesh from the inside out. The daemon inside you keeps on tearing at your soul, taking away whatever is left of your consciousness, until your body has been completely transfigured and there is nothing left of you inside it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBschaos63;One malady after the other, the daemon has completely devastated your body, to the point you yourself can barely recognize it. In the unimaginable suffering you are submitted to by your flesh slowly rotting away and worms feeding off your entrails, you finally accept the daemon's welcoming embrace to oblivion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCschaos63;No mortal indulgence can satiate your cravings any more. The burning desire instilled by the daemon is too much to bear, and it finally breaks your mind entirely as the daemon starts feasting on your soul, one delicious piece at a time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDschaos63;More and more mutations wreck your body, repurposing it to the daemon's whims. At every change, you lose another part of yourself, until there's finally nothing left but the unholy creature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos63;BLOOD AND SKULLS!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos63;The Great Father watches over you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos63;Time for some *real* fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos63;Krlleeaaaach!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos64;A never-ending rage burns through your body. You cannot rest, you cannot sleep, even the slightest wrong sends you into a roaring rampage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos64;Blood! BLOOOD!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos65;You tighten your hold on the courtier's neck, your vision blurred by rage. You don't know who that is or what he did to you, you only know that you won't find peace until you've disembowelled him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos65;Die! Die! DIE!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos66;People feel safe in passing their titles to their children. They grow lazy heirs. Worthless! The only right by blood is the one gained by spilling that of your enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos66;Only the strongest rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos66005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has issued a declaration regarding all [From.GetHerHis] vassals: from this day forward, all of your lands will be inherited only by those who show themselves worthy of them by testing their mettle in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos66005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos67;You first started just to crave more from your favourite sex, but now your lust has grown insatiable. Men, women, children... Nothing can sate your appetites any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos67;More! More!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos68;You pin the courtier on the wall and start tearing apart their clothes with inhuman strength. Your vision is blurred and you've yet to realize if you caught a man or a woman, but that surprise will be part of the fun when you slam yourself on them and start having your way with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos68;No, no, don't keep quiet! I liked you screaming...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos69;You crawl on the table, reaching for another plate further away from your reach. You've not stopped eating since morning, but the more the pain in your stomach grows, the more you feel compelled stuffing it more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos69;Glmmglrrghh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos70;You've nearly turned blind with the last barrel of wine and cannot stand on your feet any longer, but you still crawl to the next. You've lost your chalice, therefore you just hug the cask and start suckling from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos70;Glglglgllglh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos71;Why do you have to be bothered entertaining all those ugly, old harpies? From now on, only young and beautiful men shall be allowed in your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBschaos71;Why do you have to have only ugly, old men as your servant? From now on, only young and beautiful women shall be allowed in your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos71;Now we'll finally have someone interesting around here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos71005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed that henceforth only men will hold any position of worth inside [From.GetHerHis] realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBschaos71005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed that henceforth only women will hold any position of worth inside [From.GetHerHis] realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos71005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos72;You sneeze once more a copious amount of snot dropping on your chest and dripping all over your clothes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos72;Bleah...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos73;Scores of boils have appeared all over your body, another of the charming gifts bestowed upon you by the daemon inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos73;Ggghhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos74;A terrible fever has struck you, weakening your body and giving you horrible visions of the Realms of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos74;Ggghhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos75;You can barely sleep any longer. You can feel the presence of the daemon inside you, whispering, pulling your flesh from the inside, turning it into something monstrous. You can see every little detail of your body which is slowly changing, while being unable to do anything about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos75;No, no, no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos76;To each his own, and to everyone something. Your realm will be better off with the lands and title divided unevenly between all. It's certain to create a lot of interesting situations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos76;Indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos76005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed all lands to be split on death of their possessor between all of their heirs, with the main beneficiary being the one with the most support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos76005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos77;Control is but an illusion, why pretend it to exist in the first place?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos77;No more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos77005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed all laws of the realm to be null and void. Only the rule of the strong and cunning will determine the loyalty of the servants towards the masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos77005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos78;Everybody expect the firstborn to be the favourite, everybody grooms him to be the best. It is the turn of the youngest now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos78;Truly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos78005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed that enceforth all lands shall be inherited by the youngest sons and daughters of the realm and no longer the eldest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos78005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos79;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to ambush you with the help of a few guards and is now starting to recite some ominous spell while the others bind you. The chanting goes on for hours, until finally you feel the daemon being torn from you with excruciating resistance and be banished into the warp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos79;Aaaarrgghh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos79005;Luckly you manage to ambush [From.GetFirstName] with the help of a few guards and start reciting the exorcism as they bind [From.GetHerHim]. The chanting goes on for hours, until finally you see the daemon being torn from [From.GetHerHis] with excruciating resistance and be banished into the warp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos79005;Praised be [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos80;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to ambush you with the help of a few guards and is now starting to recite some ominous spell while the others bind you. The chanting goes on for hours, until finally you feel the daemon being torn from you with excruciating resistance and be banished into the warp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos80;Aaaarrgghh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos80005;You can feel it now: the daemon leaving you was nothing but an illusion! The presence has resurfaced again, gnawing at your soul!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos80005;Not again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos80006;It would seem your spell did not in fact succeeded in freeing [From.GetTitledFirstName] from the evil presence hiding inside [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos80006;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos81;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to ambush you with the help of a few guards and is now starting to recite some ominous spell while the others bind you. The chanting goes on for hours, but the daemon has sunk its teeth inside you and doesn't let the body go without dragging your soul away as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos81;Aaaarrgghh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos81005;While the exorcism started for the better, the daemon did not leave its host without consequences: the foul creature dragged away the soul of [From.GetTitledFirstName], leaving an empty and lifeless shell behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos81005;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos82;The daemon struggles as the last shred of life leaves your body. The welcoming cold of death is a balm for your mind and you can only laugh at the now-desperate attempts of the ethereal creature to hold onto you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos82;No soul left to eat. Time to leave, pathetic creature!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos83;You cannot rest, nightmares of lightning and blood tear your mind every time you try to sleep.\n'YOU DARE TO CLAIM BLOOD AND GLORY WITH COWARDLY MEANS?! HOW CAN YOU KEEP DISHONORING YOURSELF WITH MAGIC!?!.'\nIn every dream the great armoured hound looks down upon you from his throne, berating and belittling you.\n'I HAVE NO USE FOR WEAKLINGS AND DECEIVERS!';;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos83;Continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos83;Then take away the stain of magic, Lord of Skulls, so that I may serve you better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos84;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has requested you to prepare a summoning circle, for [From.GetSheHe] desires for you to call a daemon from the Realms of Chaos and bind the creature into [From.GetHerHis] service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos84;Very well, I shall do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos84;No. It's not worth the risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos85;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has refused your request, pointing you out the dangers of opening a portal to the Realm of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos85;Hmpf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos86;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has accepted your requests. When the fateful night comes, [From.GetSheHe] prepares the summoning circle and all the needed ingredients and, with you at [From.GetHerHis] side, starts chanting the summoning spell that will bring a daemon into your world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos87;You are not sure of what is happening until too late: the ritual has failed. A host of terrifying daemons break through the summoning circle to drag you and the sorcerer into the Realms of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos87;Noooooo!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos88;Your ritual for [From.GetFirstName] was a success. You've managed to bind a raving Flamer to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos88;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos89;Your ritual for [From.GetFirstName] was a success. You've managed to bind a decomposing Plaguebearer to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos89;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos90;Your ritual for [From.GetFirstName] was a success. You've managed to bind an alluring Daemonette to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos90;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos91;Your ritual for [From.GetFirstName] was a success. You've managed to bind a brutal Bloodletter to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos91;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GHROND;Ghrond;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic2;By decree of the Witch King all women who show the potential for sorcery must turn themselves in so as to be properly trained in Ghrond, where they study the lore of dark magic in one of the six Covens founded by Morathi. They shall take no man nor bear any children and will live on only to serve the Witch King as his spiritual brides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic2;I will relinquish my possessions and go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBdarkelfmagic2;No! I can still hide it... Keep on living like this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic2005;Your attempt at hiding your potential in magic could not go unnoticed forever to the eyes of Naggaroth. The servants of the Witch King have discovered your secret in the end and forced you to go to Ghrond, as it is your duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic20005;It was good while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic3;Your daughter shows talent for magic, she has therefore been sent to Ghrond to study with the Covens of Morathi. This is a great honour for your house, as she will now become a bride of the Witch King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic3;A great honour indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic4;Another daughter of a noble house has been recognized as a potential apprentice and has been sent to Ghrond to receive proper teaching and become a Sorceress of the Covens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic4;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic5;The trials of Ghrond are harsh and unforgiving. Only the most gifted and cunning amongst the druchii summoned will manage to achieve mastery over the dark powers and claim their place as Sorceresses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic5;I must keep learning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAdarkelfmagic6;You've spent years in the dark tower and all your hard work has finally paid off. You have taken your rightful place as a bride of the Witch King, a Sorceress of the Coven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBdarkelfmagic6;Despite your best intentions, you have not managed to pass all the trials and the ruling hags of Ghrond have not deemed you worthy of taking place amongst them. Bound against your will, you shall be turned into a mindless servant, only employed to satiate the Witch King's lust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic6;So I have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBdarkelfmagic6;Gooooohhh...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic6005;Your daughter has shown herself to be worthy of the title of Sorceress. She has taken her place within the Covens, bringing more honour to your great House.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic6005;Good for her. And for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic6006;Your daughter has disgraced herself: she was not able to pass the final tests to become a proper Sorceress and has now been reduced to a worthless mindless slave in the Witch King's harem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic6006;Disgusting child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos58;Your Master seems a little lonely. Maybe the mortal would like to spend some quality time with you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos58;HmmmHmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HOETH;Hoeth;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChighelfmagic2;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] thinks you show talent in magic and has signed you up to study with the Loremasters of Hoeth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOTAhighelfmagic2;A great honour!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChighelfmagic3;Every Apprentice in Hoeth has to dedicate himself to countless hours of study to assimilate the centuries of knowledge accumulated in the great libraries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhighelfmagic3;I'll do my best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChighelfmagic4;The scion of a noble house shows talent for magic and has been sent to be taught amongst the Loremasters of Hoeth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhighelfmagic4;We will welcome this new apprentice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhighelfmagic5;The your long years of study have finally paid off. You can feel the magic within you and have been officially recognized as a respected Asur Mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBhighelfmagic5;Despite your efforts, Magic just doesn't seem the right path for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhighelfmagic5;I will use these powers wisely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBhighelfmagic5;I tried my best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChighelfmagic5005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has achieved [From.GetHerHis] goal and graduated from Hoeth as an official Asur Mage, a prestigious accomplishment for [From.GetHerHim] and your House.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhighelfmagic5005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChighelfmagic5006;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] was unable to reach [From.GetHerHis] full potential and, after a series of mishaps, has been expelled from Hoeth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhighelfmagic5006;You're a disgrace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice10001;A foul Sorcerer has come to your lands, claiming to have had visions of your future victories from the Gods. The wandering traveller is willing to settle in your court in exchange for a meagre price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice10001;You are welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice10001;We have no such money to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice10002;A Shaman has come to your lands, gaining some favour amongst the locals. The soothsayer is willing to join your court and provide their services for a meagre price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice10002;You are welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice10002;We have no such money to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice10003;A mysterious visitor from the deserts has come to your court. Apparently he is a famous scholar from a faraway land, gifted in the arts of magic and he'd be willing to stay and offer his services to you for a meagre pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice10003;You are welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice10003;We have no such money to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice10004;A travelling Witch has decided to settle at your court. She has requested a few things for her stay, but there's no way of you to refusing her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice10004;You... are welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice2;Your guardian has the reputation of a powerful magician. And being in the company of such an individual has made you wondering if you could become a mage as well, when you grow up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice2;Can you teach me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice3;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has expressed a desire to learn magic from you as your apprentice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice3;Of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice3;Not a chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice4;You're taking too long. Perhaps you do not have the gift of magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice4;Drats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice5;[From.GetFirstName] does not think you have what it takes to wield magic and has dismissed your request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice5;But I do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice6;You've been delighted to know your [GetFromRelation] was quite happy to take you as [From.GetHerHis] apprentice and teach you in the ways of the Winds of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice6;Yes! I won't disappoint you, I promise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice7;Teaching someone how to feel and channel the Winds of Magic is no easy task. What do you want [From.GetFirstName] to be taught?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice7;I'll teach [From.GetHerHim] about caution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice7;A mage must keep an open mind and experiment new things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice7;One cannot channel the arcane powers without focus and discipline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice7;It is time to test [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice70001;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you of how a mage should be cautious. Of how tricky and deceitful daemons are and of how so easily a spell can turn in a catastrophe fore everyone involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice70001;I'll try and be careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice70002;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you of how a mage should be bold and inventing. Of how you shouldn't just learn from [From.GetHerHim], but search your own knowledge and create new ways of turning the Winds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice70002;I will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice70003;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you of how a mage should never lose his calm and maintain absolute discipline at all times, for it is a vital component for casting even the simplest spell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice70003;I'm trying to, really!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice70004;You've spent years over dusty tomes and stinking potions under your [GetFromRelation]'s tutelage, but it has all paid off: you can feel the magic inside you and call it through your will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice70004;You've spent years over dusty tomes and stinking potions under your [GetFromRelation]'s tutelage, but it was all for naught: you're no closer to casting the first cantrip as you were when you started.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice70004;This is just the beginning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice70004;Why can't I do it?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice8;Your work with [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has paid off: [From.GetSheHe] has started casting [From.GetHerHis] first spells without any help and is likely to go on [From.GetHerHis] studies without need of your tutelage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice8;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice80005;It seems your [GetFromRelation] has succeeded in [From.GetHerHis] apprenticeship and is now a fully qualified mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice80005;A great accomplishment for sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice80006;Your work with [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been in vain: [From.GetSheHe] doesn't appear able to call for the Winds of Magic and might as well have no power at all in [From.GetHerHis] blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice80006;What a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice80007;It seems your [GetFromRelation] has failed in [From.GetHerHis] apprenticeship and is unlikely to ever become a mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice80007;What a loss...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice9;The Winds of Chaos will favour only the chosen ones of the Gods. To prepare [From.GetFirstName] [From.GetSheHe] must give in to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and his unholy worship and live by his tenets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice9;I will speak to [From.GetHerHim] of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice9;I will teach [From.GetHerHim] the tenets of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice9;All the same, [From.GetSheHe] needs to learn of incantation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice9;I feel the Gods will soon test [From.GetHerHis] resolve...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90001;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending quite a lot of time talking about someone called the Changer of Ways and of how he could grant you infinite powers beyond your imagination, if only you were to forsake the faith of your ancestors and embrace him as your only Master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90001;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending quite a lot of time talking about someone called the Lord of the Flies and of how his warm embrace could grant you great powers and a safe haven from pain and death, if only you were to forsake the faith of your ancestors and love him back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90001;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending quite a lot of time talking about someone called the Dark Prince and how he could make you feel better than you ever did in your entire life and show you marvels beyond your comprehension, if only you were to relinquish the faith of your ancestors and bow to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90001;Seems a good bargain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice90001;No, I don't like him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90002;[From.GetFirstName] has finally accepted of how only Tzeentch can lead [From.GetHerHim] to the true mastery over the Winds of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90002;[From.GetFirstName] has finally understood and welcomed the unconditioned love of Papa Nurgle in [From.GetHerHis] heart, hoping to receive his gift in return soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90002;[From.GetFirstName] has finally felt Slaanesh's touch and yearns for more, aware of the uncharted heights of pleasure [From.GetSheHe] has still to reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90002;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90003;[From.GetFirstName] is still stubbornly refusing to accept Tzeentch as [From.GetHerHis] new Master. For some reason [From.GetSheHe] does not understand how only the uncontested Lord of Magic could grant [From.GetHerHim] the power you have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90003;[From.GetFirstName] is still rudely rejecting Nurgle's love. The Lord of the Flies is magnanimous and will keep bestowing his gifts, as will you, hoping in a change of heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90003;[From.GetFirstName] is still squeamish about the delights Slaanesh and you are presenting to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90003;Everyone comes around, eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90004;It's hard to sleep after all your [GetFromRelation] warns you about everyday. Everyone is everyone's enemy. Power can be gained only through deceit and a cunning mind. You will only ever manage to learn magic from [From.GetHerHim] by stealing [From.GetHerHis] knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90004;It was a little disconcerting at starts, but having to not worry about cuts and illness is such a relief. Your [GetFromRelation]'s god is truly a kind and generous Master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90004;It's hard to understand half of the things your [GetFromRelation] tells and does to you, but you've started to gain more and more curiosity as you experienced the delights offered by the Dark Prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90004;But what about spells?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice90005;[From.GetFirstName] has finally decided to spare some time to teach you about mustering control over the Winds of Chaos. Most of it is still gibberish to you, but you cannot do much about it, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90005;What does this mean?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90007;The Changer of Ways has seen fit to bless your pupil with power over reality, as you knew he would. Your [GetFromRelation] is set up on a path to greatness. In fact, maybe you were to generous to the little brat. What if [From.GetSheHe] becomes a threat to your plans, now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90007;Grandfather Nurgle has bestowed a most precious gift upon your apprentice, allowing [From.GetHerHim] to finally have full control over the Winds of Chaos. Soon, your young new friends will share the love of the Lord of the Flies to many more unwilling people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90007;The Serpent is pleased with you and your pupil and has seen fit to grant [From.GetHerHim] a speck of his power to let [From.GetHerHis] fantasies grow wilder still.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90007;Success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90008;The plans of Tzeentch go beyond the comprehension of the rabble. Evidently your [GetFromRelation] was not gifted enough and when the Changer of Ways touched [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetHerHis] body and mind could not bear his awesome power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90008;Sadly, for once, Papa Nurgle might have been a little too generous: your [GetFromRelation] has collapsed beneath his many gifts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90008;Your [GetFromRelation] revealed [From.GetHerHim]self a failure. Your pupil just doesn't seem to have enough imagination for you or your Dark Prince's tastes, despite [From.GetHerHis] many despertate efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90008;What a waste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice10;A rush of power goes through your body each time you invoke one of Tzeentch's names, the Winds of Magic ready to bow to your every whim and warp reality at a mere gesture of your hands. Truly, your long years of study with [From.GetFirstName] have paid off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice10;Many gifts has Grandfather Nurgle bestowed upon you, but it finally came the time for magic to be amongst them. There so much you feel you can do right now and the Lord of the Flies is certain to give you all the time you could wish for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice10;Magic has finally come to you and you could barely spend any time sleeping in the past week: so much to experiment, so much to change and cut and sew with invisible fingers and unearthly precision. The Serpent has given you his greatest tool to express your art across the entire world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice10;Finally! Power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice11;Graboliwayghsggrksukaeàfakjcsahxbghhhhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice11;Papa Nurgle has blessed you just too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice11;Slaanesh is still unimpressed with you. It looks like you've lost his interest and won't become a mage any time soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice11;Noooooo!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos83005;Yes...', the vulture muttered, clawing at your shoulders. '...he doesn't need you... and you do not need him. Come with me, little soldier, I will show you how to lead...'\n\n'TRUE GLORY CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY FACING YOUR ENEMIES!!'\n\n'I can show you wondrous things and make reality itself bend to your whims.';;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos83005;Show me your world, o Changer of Ways!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos83005;Then take away the stain of magic, Lord of Skulls, so that I may serve you better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice12;You've decided to undertake the arduous task of learning magic by your own. You do not know how long will it take, nor if you have the potential to become a mage in the first place, but you're determined to find out. Which branch of magic would you like to focus your efforts on?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice12;The Lore of Ice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice12;The Lore of Metal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice12;The Lore of Fire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice12;The Lore of Death;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEsorcererapprentice12;The Lore of Shadows;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFsorcererapprentice12;The Lore of Beasts;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTGsorcererapprentice12;The Lore of Heavens;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTHsorcererapprentice12;The Lore of Light;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTIsorcererapprentice12;The Lore of Life;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice13;Learning magic with no tutor nor organization of learned experts at your back is no easy task. How would you like to proceed next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice13;I need to buy more books and materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice13;I'll experiment and see what happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice13;I need to buy more books and materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice13;I'll experiment and see what happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice13001;The more your personal laboratory increases in size, the higher the chances of unlocking your true magical potential. But you've still a long way to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice13001;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice13002;You do not know exactly what you are doing, but you hope that by cautious observation of the trial and error method, you will manage to understand the mysteries of the Winds of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice13002;Now, if I mix this with that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice13003;The explosion was luckily contained, but it still managed to wound you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice13003;Damnations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice13004;A potion explodes right into your face, slowly melting your skin off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice13004;Aaaarrgghh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice13005;This is likely to be your last experiment. The resulting explosion has destroyed your laboratory and blown away half of your body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice13005;Grrlllcht...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice14;It's been hard trying to figure it all out with no materials, no school, no master, but you've made it: you can feel your power and call upon it using the proper words and gestures. You are finally a mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice14;You've tried your best, but without a Master you're just running blind. There's no way you'll ever learn magic this way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice14;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice14;Damn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons1;As the executioner approaches, the daemon spits a curse in the dark tongue and disappears in a flash, leaving no trace behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons1;Hopefully the headman's axe scared it off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons2;No cell can hold a creature of the warp. A few words and reality bends to facilitate your escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons2;Free again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons3;There are so many mortals to play with. So sad they are so easy to break.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons3;There's more where this came from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons4;You've rallied an experienced group of hunters, hoping they will manage to track and destroy the evil creature infesting your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons4;Go forth and bring me its head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons40001;The hunters have returned to you with the head of the wretched daemon. Your realm is finally free of its evil presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons40001;Rejoice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons40002;The hunters tried their best, but the daemon eluded their traps. It left only their mangled remains as a warning against future attempts to eliminate it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons40002;Hmm... hopefully we have reserves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons5;The minds of the mortals are easy to manipulate and you take a special delight in pitting those clueless fools one against the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons5;Yeah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons50001;Sometimes you cannot just stand the sight of your friends and colleagues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons50001;I hate you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons6;There are so many people waiting to receive the gifts of the Lord of the Flies. And you have plenty to give yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons6;Gloorrrgh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons60001;You've been feeling rather sick, when suddenly horrible rashes and boils erupt from your skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons60001;Gh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons7;The mortals entangled themselves so beautifully with lust and lies. It takes only a little nudge to let the shroud unravel in a wondrous cascade of passion and violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons7;Glamorous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons70001;Each night you dream of your spouse in bed with someone else. Last night, you could see their faces, you are certain now this is no dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons70001;How could you!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons8;Isn't it wondrous to roam free in the lands to spread Chaos wherever and whenever you please?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons8;It sure is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.0;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] approaches you with a hungry gaze and you realize your [GetFromFromRelation] has decided to feast upon you. The vampire seems aware of your fears and tries to calm you down, reassuring you that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] wishes to give you the dark gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIREB.0;When you meet [FromFrom.GetFirstName] in [FromFrom.GetHerHis] room, the reason for your summoning becomes clear: [GetFromFromRelation] wishes to turn you into [From.GetHerHis] thrall and share your friendship forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIREC.0;You meet with [FromFrom.GetFirstName] under the pale moonlight and before [FromFrom.GetSheHe] can even speak, you know what [FromFrom.GetSheHe]'s about to ask: your [GetFromFromRelation] wishes you to share in [FromFrom.GetHerHis] love for all eternity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRED.0;Your [GetFromFromRelation] has called you to [FromFrom.GetHerHis] rooms and is now ordering you to lay down. It appears [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has decided to honour you with [FromFrom.GetHerHis] dark gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAvampire0;Kiss me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBvampire0;I will never be like you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCvampire0;No! Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIREA.11;Your [GetFromRelation] has asked you for the dark gift, and swears eternal fealty if you would but grant this heartfelt desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIREB.11;Your friend [From.GetFirstName] has asked you for the dark gift, stating that [From.GetSheHe] wants to follow and assist you beyond death itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIREC.11;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has asked you for the dark gift, wishing to share your love for eternity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRED.11;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has asked you for the dark gift, stating [From.GetSheHe] could not bear the thought of death ending your shared bond and forcing [From.GetSheHe] to leave you alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIREA.12;Your [GetFromRelation] bestows the dark gift upon you, and bids you serve [From.GetHerHim] faithfully until the end of your days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIREB.12;The bounds of friendship will outlast the fickle nature of life, at least for what concerns you and [From.GetFirstName]. Your [GetFromRelation] has agreed to grant you the dark gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIREC.12;Death shall not part you and [From.GetFirstName]: once [From.GetSheHe] has bestowed upon you [From.GetHerHis] dark blessing, you awake as preternatural creature of the night, to be at [From.GetHerHis] side forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRED.12;Love will conquer death itself: [From.GetFirstName] gave you the dark kiss and you are now bound together as immortal souls, forever sharing your passion for each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBVAMPIRE15;I have no desire to join this bloodline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE150001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has refused your request to take [From.GetHerHis] place within your coven, thus staining your reputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE150001;A fledgling disobeying [Root.GetHerHis] Sire?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE15002;One of your fledglings, [FromFrom.GetFirstName], has come to you asking to fully join your coven and be recognized as a member of your ancestral bloodline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE150002;We accept you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBVAMPIRE150002;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCVAMPIRE150002;You shall never be of this coven!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE150003;Your sire [From.GetFirstName] has denied you your request. While the same blood runs through your veins, you're yet to be recognized as part of the coven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE150003;My time will come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE150004;Your sire [From.GetFirstName] has denied you your request. While the same blood runs through your veins, you're yet to be recognized as part of the coven. And by heeding [From.GetHerHim], you might never be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE150004;My time will come... one way or another...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE150005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has accepted your request and allowed you to fully join in [From.GetHerHis] dark coven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE150005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE150006;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has gracefully accepted your offer and joined fully in your ancient coven, completely identifying with your bloodline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE150006;As [From.GetSheHe] should have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.2;Your sire has fully accepted you as a member of their coven, yet you've still to receive a proper title within the household's possessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.2;I will ask what is my right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires.2;I can wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.3;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has come to you requesting a formal recognition by granting [From.GetHerHim] rulership over a part of your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.3;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires.3;I shall decide when it is time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.4;[From.GetFirstName] has granted your wish and bestowed upon you a holding to rule in the name of [From.GetHerHis] coven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.4;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.5;[From.GetFirstName] has denied your wish, berating you for trying to give [From.GetHerHim] commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.5;But I deserve this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires8;Your [GetFromFromRelation] calls for you with a gentle tone, but when you near [FromFrom.GetHerHim] you realize too late that the dark creature has decided to feast upon your blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires8;No! Leave me alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires9;There truly is nothing more delicious than virgin blood. Your [GetFromRelation] has left the world of the living and joined you as child of the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires9;Good for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92;The Blood God watches over you from his throne of skulls. What is your offer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92;The greatest pyre to ever burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos92;A great offering, so that he might remember me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos92;A large offering, so that he might notice me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos92;A small offering, to show my loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92001;The Lord of Skulls is pleased with your offering. With a flash of fire and a burst of blood, a daemonic apparition floats down from the sky, allowing you to pick a boon of your choosing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92001;Some of your warriors, to crush my enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos92001;Fill me with your strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos92001;Fill me with your energy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92002;The Lord of Skulls must be pleased with you, for after you offering has been burned, a daemonic creature tears its way into reality to offer its services to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92002;You'll follow my orders from now on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92003;The Blood God favours you. As your offering burns, you feel yourself filling with unholy rage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92003;Raaaahhhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92004;The ground cracks and a great river of blood bursts forth to cover you and your followers. Clearly the Lord of Skulls looks you favourably.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92004;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92005;The Blood God favours you. As your offering burns, you feel yourself filling with rage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92005;Raaaahhhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92006;The smoke of your offering creates intricate designs, you can see the grand design of your patron, finally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92006;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92008;Despite your effort, the Lord of Skulls has not reacted to your offering. Perhaps you've not given enough to satiate his thirst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92008;Grmmmh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93;Papa Nurgle is always ready to dispense his gifts to all who are in need. All the same, he's happy to receive offering from his own followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93;The greatest pyre to ever burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos93;A great offering, so that he might remember me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos93;A large offering, so that he might notice me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos93;A small offering, to show my loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93001;The smoke of your offering covers the field with a noxious fog and a jolly voice resonates in your ears, thanking you for your gift and asking to pick a boon of your choosing in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93001;I wish to receive magic, to better spread your gifts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos93001;I wish my servants to love me as I love you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos93001;I wish to share your gifts with all of my servants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93002;Papa Nurgle must be really pleased with you, for after you offering has been burned, a daemonic creature claws out of the ground, ready to hug and serve you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93002;I'm so happy to meet you, friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93003;As your offering burns, you feel the love of Nurgle filling your heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93003;Why can't we just all get along?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93004;The smoke of your offering covers the field with a noxious green fog, undoubtedly proving the Lord of the Flies' unconditional love for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93004;I love you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93005;As your offering burns, you feel Nurgle's generosity filling your heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93005;Let everyone share in his gifts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93006;The fumes of the pyre fill your lungs and you can see the marvellous future the Lord of Flies has in store for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93006;I'm coming Papa!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93008;Papa Nurgle has certainly accepted your present, but it could be that others are in greater need of his gifts than you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93008;Don't worry, I'll wait for next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94;The Serpent always thirsts for more delights and greedily takes anything which is offered up. What will you offer Slaanesh?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94;The greatest pyre to ever burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos94;A great offering, so that he might remember me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos94;A large offering, so that he might notice me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos94;A small offering, to show my loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94001;The Dark Prince's voice resonates in your mind, you can feel his touch crawling beneath your skin. Your offering has momentarily pleased your Master, to the point they'll grant you a gift of your choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94001;Grant me mastery over the Winds of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos94001;Make me beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos94001;Heal my body so that I may be whole again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94002;One of the bodies on the pyre stands up and shakes off the flames, shambling away from the others. As it moves, the flesh crawls and flickers and when it reaches you, you realize it is a daemon, a gift from the Dark Prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94002;Let us know each other, yes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94003;Like a beacon, the pyre draws a black pegasus to the field. The wild creature descends upon you and bows at your feet, clearly a gift from the Serpent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94003;How about turning around now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94004;The Dark Prince's voice resonates in your mind, you can feel his touch crawling beneath your skin. The Serpent's sweet words clearly show you must be amongst his favourites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94004;Never doubted it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94005;As the flames burn on the pyre, so too does a new lust inflame your soul, rekindled by the Dark Prince's touch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94006;The bodies on the pyre create the most interesting shapes while they burn. You can see the artistry of your Master behind them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94006;Yes... yes it is so clear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94008;You've waited until the last embers have gone cold, but there has been no response from your Master. The Dark Prince must have a poor disposition today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94008;Rats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95;The Changer of Ways is fickle in his rewards and greedy in his requests. What shall you give to him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95;The greatest pyre to ever burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos95;A great offering, so that he might remember me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos95;A large offering, so that he might notice me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos95;A small offering, to show my loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95001;Motes of unnatural light dance over the pyre and you can feel the Architect of Fate is looking at you, ready to grant your heart's desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95001;Magic! Grant me the true power of Chaos!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos95001;Knowledge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos95001;More power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95002;One of the bodies on the pyre explodes in a shower of gore. The melted remains come together into an unnatural shrieking mix, a daemonic gift from your Master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95002;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95003;As the smoke rises, you can feel the touch of Tzeentch upon you. The Changer of Ways has given you his greatest gift: magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95003;Power over reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95004;The shining smokes and twisting flames undoubtedly show the favour of your patron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95004;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95005;The Architect of Fate has looked at your offer and filled your mind with new and greater plans for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95005;Yes, there's greatness in store for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95006;The Architect of Fate has looked at your offer and filled your mind with new and greater plans for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95006;Yes, there's greatness in store for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95008;The Great Plotter's plan is yet to be uncovered. Nothing happened after your offering was sent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95008;Next time... next time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos96;The Gods blessed you on the fields of battle today. Your patron's eye is looking right inside your soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos96;I am victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos97;Only the best survive the endless trials of the gods. You are more than all the others, you are a true champion of your patron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos97;Glorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos98;There is no doubt your god has something special in mind for you. You have received many gifts and have ascended as a chosen servant of your deity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos98;I shall be eternal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos99;The time has come. You've endured hardship, you've survived all of your patron's generous gifts, you've outdone the efforts of others to please your deity, and he has finally rewarded you with the ultimate gift: you leave your old husk and in a storm of twisting bone and melding flesh you achieve apotheosis and are reborn as an immortal Daemon Prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos99;Reaaaahhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos100;[From.GetFirstName] struggles desperately within your clutches, but it's too late for [From.GetHerHim]. You open your jaws and suck [From.GetHerHis] delicious soul from the pathetic husk, feasting upon [From.GetHerHis] essence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos100;Marvellous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos101;The terrible daemon who captured you has the worst in store for you: dragging you out of your cage with its claws, the creature reaps your soul out of the body and feasts upon it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos101;Hhhhhhhhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos102;The host of daemons emerges from the aether, ready to follow your lead and scourge the lands of the mortals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos102;March!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos104;Your daemonic forces disband, dragged back into the Realms of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15;Learning magic with no tutor nor organization of learned experts at your back is no easy task. Necromancy also has quite the bad reputation. How would you like to proceed next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15;I need to buy more books and materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15;I'll experiment and see what happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice15;I need to buy more books and materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice15;I'll experiment and see what happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15001;The more your personal laboratory increases in size, the higher the chances of unlocking your true magical potential. But you've still a long way to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15001;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15002;You do not know exactly what you are doing, but you hope that by cautious observation of the trial and error method, you will come to understand the mysteries of the Winds of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15002;If only there was an easier way to find fresh corpses...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15003;It is said that the secret of necromancy lies within the clutches of the undead. Yet, with the proper resources, you might be able to search for a copy of Nagash's books and reach enlightenment without the need to grovel at the feet of a vampire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15003;I shall search for the book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15003;This is beneath me. My will already moves the dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice15003;I will ask my dread liege for assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice15003;I can manage on my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15004;It has taken a considerable amount of time and money, but finally a copy of the Liber Mortis, written by the Great Necromancer, is within your hands. And yet, now that you can see the ancient book, you are not certain if you could handle the dark secrets hidden within its pages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15004;It's too late to turn back now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15004;I do not dare to open it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15005;The secrets within the works of Nagash might be unbearable for weaker minds, but they could not break your will or your thirst for knowledge. You've discovered more than you could possibly imagine within those old pages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15006;The secrets within the works of Nagash might be unbearable for weaker minds, but they could not break your will or your thirst for knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15006;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15007;You've learned much from the works of Nagash, but the cursed words have slowly wormed their way into your mind, giving you distorted visions of the future and horrid hallucinations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15007;No! Get it away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15008;The secrets of the book were too much for your mind to handle. The dark forces embedded within the cursed writings of the Great Necromancer destroyed your mind and left you a withered husk. Perhaps someone more fortunate will continue your work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15008;Hhhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15009;As an ancient King of Nehekhara, the power of the dead is already entwined within your very essence. Thousands of servants awake at your command, answering to the call of their old master. Yet you cannot create more. Perhaps experimenting upon your undead subject might unlock the secret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15009;It is necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15009;I shall not harm my loyal servants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15010;Your undead servants have submitted to your wishes, allowing you to perform all sorts of experiments upon them. In the repetitive and orderly fashion, hallmark of the Nehekharan society, you've managed to slowly make progress with your studies. You finally start to see the merits of Nagash's methods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15010;Good. Another hundred here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15011;Regardless of the countless servants spent and days of study and experimenting, the secret of Nagash's necromancy still eludes you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15011;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15012;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has gained an interest in necromancy. Clueless as [From.GetSheHe] is on the matters of death and unlife, [From.GetSheHe] has wisely decided to ask you for guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice15012;Sure, I will teach you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15012;I can teach you, but only if you abandon your gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15012;Let me kiss you and you shall know everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice15012;You're not worthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15013;[From.GetFirstName] is interested in helping you uncover the secrets of the dark arts, but only if you forsake your gods and bow to the unliving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15013;As you command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15013;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15014;[From.GetFirstName] has accepted your terms and abandoned [From.GetHerHis] failed gods to follow you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15014;Good... Let me educate you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15015;[From.GetFirstName] has refused your terms, preferring to cling to [From.GetHerHis] failed gods rather than learn the secrets of eternal life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15015;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15016;[From.GetFirstName] has considered your request and decided to assist you, with no request on [From.GetHerHis] part.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15016;A great gift, thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15017;[From.GetFirstName] has accepted to help you, but only if you first allow [From.GetHerHim] to bestow upon you the dark gift. As it stands, [From.GetFirstName] assures you your studies will be much easier once you've become an immortal undead as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15017;A great opportunity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15017;I wish to control the dead, not be one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15018;Your [GetFromRelation] has accepted your terms and allowed you in [From.GetHerHis] chambers so that you could give [From.GetHerHim] the dark kiss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15019;Your [GetFromRelation] has stubbornly refused your gift, still too attached to [From.GetHerHis] fleeting life to see the wisdom in your offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15019;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15020;Sadly, [From.GetFirstName] has not considered you worthy of receiving [From.GetHerHis] ancient knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15020;On my own, then. As usual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice16;It's been hard trying to figure it all out with no materials, no school, no master, but you've made it, you're finally a necromancer. Through your will, the dead can walk and speak once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice16;You've tried your best, but without a guide you're just running blind. There's no way you'll ever learn the secrets of undeath this way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice16;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice16;Damnation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice17;Your [GetFromRelation] has approached you, offering [From.GetHerHis] knowledge of the dark arts. For some reason [From.GetSheHe] believes you might become a powerful necromancer under [From.GetHerHis] guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice17;Sounds intriguing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice17;Not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice18;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has rejected your offer of power over death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice18;The fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice19;Teaching necromancy is no easy task. There are many dangers waiting in the art of summoning the spirits of the dead and sparking a semblance of life within corpses. What should you have your apprentice focus their attention on?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice19;Caution is what's really important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice19;Daring is what a necromancer needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice19;Focus above everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice19;It is time to test [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice19001;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you how a necromancer should be cautious. One should never be taken by surprise by how easily a spirit could break its chains or an horde lose its purpose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice19001;I'll try and be careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice19002;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you how a necromancer should be bold and daring. You must harden yourself to the horrors you'll witness and never hesitate in your choices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice19002;I will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice19003;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you how a necromancer should always remain calm and maintain absolute discipline at all times, for it is a vital component for casting even the simplest spell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice19003;Of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice19004;You've succeeded, you can feel the dark power flowing through your veins, compelling the dead to listen to your commands. You are a necromancer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice19004;Despite your best efforts, it seems necromancy is not the right thing for you. Your many years of study qualified you only for graverobbing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice19004;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice19004;Damnations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice20;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has exceeded your expectations. Under [From.GetHerHis] will, the dead walk again. Your work is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice20;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice20005;It would seem your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has taken a dark path and mastered the art of necromancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice20005;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice20006;[From.GetFirstName] revealed [From.GetHerHim]self to be a failure. Despite your efforts, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't seem capable of mastering the dark arts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice20006;What a waste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice20007;It would seem your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]'s attempts at mastering the art of Necromancy ended in failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice20007;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires10;As the blood of the sacrifice runs across the altar, you feel the Wind of Death blow stronger. Another step closer to your ritual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires10;Yes. We need more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires11;You are ready to perform your necromantic ritual. The greater the power you will commit, the greater the horde which will be raised from the grave to obey your commands. At least, until they fall apart once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11;All shall fall and serve me in death!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires11;A great host to bring fear to my enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires11;A large horde to serve my every need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsvampires11;A small horde, nothing excessive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEsvampires11;Only a few servants for my personal needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11001;Once the spell has been completed, a few hundred skeletons and zombies gather before you, ready to obey your every order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires12001;The remaining corpses in your small horde fall back into the ground, devoid of life once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11002;Once the spell has been completed, a few hundred skeletons and zombies gather before you, ready to obey your every order. Looking at them, they seem to be a little more numerous than you expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11002;All the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires12002;The remaining undead in your small horde fall back into the ground, devoid of life once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11003;Once the spell has been completed, thousands of skeletons and other undead gather before you, ready to obey your every order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11003;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires12003;Your small horde finally falls apart, once more lacking any semblance of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAsvampires12004;Your small horde finally falls apart, devoid once more of any semblance of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAsvampires11005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires12005;Your horde of undead finally falls apart, devoid once more of any energy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAsvampires12006;Your horde of undead finally falls apart, devoid once more of any semblance of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11007;Once your ritual ends all of the land before you has withered and a great host of undead has risen, filling the fields, ready to do your bidding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11007;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires12007;Your great horde of undead finally falls apart, devoid once more of any semblance of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11008;Once your ritual ends all of the land before you has withered and a great host of undead has risen, filling the fields, ready to do your bidding. They are so many, you can barely see the ground on which they walk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11008;All the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires12008;Your great horde of undead finally falls apart, devoid once more of any semblance of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11009;Only the Great Necromancer himself could have outdone such a feat: you've sucked all life from this land and through your great ritual an endless horde of corpses has arisen to follow your whims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11009;To war, my minions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires12009;The strain is too much and your titanic horde finally falls apart, returning to the dirt once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAsvampires12010;The strain is too much and your titanic horde finally falls apart, returning to the dirt once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14;You've studied [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s routine for some time and believe you could hire an agent to slip through to [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] resting place and steal the ring at the right moment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14;My co-conspirators will provide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires14;I'll take proper precautions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires14;We need an experienced burglar for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsvampires14;Too risky - I will bide my time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14001;This might be the right time. A good thief could sneak and steal the ring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14001;Ask the Plot head for funds;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires14001;I'll take the proper precautions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires14001;We need an experienced burglar for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsvampires14001;Too risky - I will bide my time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14002;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], is asking for funds to hire a thief in order to steal [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring while [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] is resting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14002;Very well - too bad I will not see it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires14002;Even [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] death is not worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14003;[From.GetTitledName] has sent me the necessary funds to steal [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14004;[From.GetTitledName] has refused to fund the master thief needed to steal [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14004;I will pay for it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires14004;Forget it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14005;There are no dreams accompanying your rest during daylight, only the stillness of full death, the one true time when you look no different from a corpse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14005;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires14005;And yet.. I feel someone's touch...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14006;There are no dreams accompanying your rest during daylight, only the stillness of full death, but you can still feel the thief's touch on your hand. The vile man has fled the room once you finally awake, but you've smelled his scent before...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14006;A million deaths for [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14007;There are no dreams accompanying your rest during daylight, only the stillness of full death, you can only feel the touch of the thief once he's long gone, along with your ring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14007;My ring! My ring!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14008;There are no dreams accompanying your rest during daylight, only the stillness of full death, but you can still feel the thief's touch on your hand. With a sudden gesture your claws snap at his neck, raising the pathetic mortal from the ground and holding him still until he whispers terrified the name of his employer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14008;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]? So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14009;There are no dreams accompanying your rest during daylight, only the stillness of full death, but you can still feel the thief's touch on your hand. With a sudden gesture your claws snap at his neck, but the wretched mortal is fast enough to flee, albeit empty-handed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14009;Who could have sent him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14010;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], has let me know that [From.GetSheHe] has finally found a man skilled and brave enough to try and steal [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14010;He better not screw this up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14011;[From.GetTitledName] approves of your idea to hire an agent to steal [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14011;Make the preparations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14012;[From.GetTitledName] has let me know that the plot to steal [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring is proceeding well. The thief will act on [From.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] while [From.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] rests within one month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14012;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14013;Success! [From.GetTitledName]'s ring is in your hands. Unfortunately, your complicity was discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14013;Good. But... bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14014;Success! That thief was really as skilled as he boasted. [From.GetTitledName] has lost [From.GetHerHis] ring and knows nothing of your involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14014;And now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14015;Failure! [From.GetTitledName] captured the thief and squeezed your name out of him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14015;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14016;Failure! [From.GetTitledName] woke before the thief could steal the ring, but my complicity has not been revealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14016;We will just have to try again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPsvampires14010;Tell [This.GetTitledName] of the idea to steal [This.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPsvampires14002;Ask [This.GetTitledName] for funds to steal [This.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPsvampires14003;[This.GetTitledName] receives the funds;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPsvampires14004;Inform [This.GetTitledName] that I will not pay;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPsvampires14005;Steal [This.GetTitledName]'s ring during [This.GetHerHis] rest next month;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPsvampires14011;Approve the plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires13001;The dreaded ring of [From.GetFirstName] now lies within your hands. Through this wicked artifact [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been able to return from death time and again. Legend has it any vampire could master such a power by wearing this trinket.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires13001;And it is MINE now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires13001;I will make sure nobody will ever see this thing again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires13002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has wrested control over the powerful Carstein Ring and now rules over [From.GetHerHis] undead hordes backed by its promise of immortality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires13002;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14017;It has been days now, but still no trace of the thief. The wretched scum must have fled who knows where with your ring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14017;A thousand curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TERROR_FROM_DARKNESS;Terror from Darkness;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCMOUNTS.9;Vampires have been known to use their innate necromantic powers to piece together monstrous creatures that would fly them into the night and upon their prey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTMOUNTS.9.b;I've better things to spend time on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCMOUNTS.10;After months of hard work, the monster is finally ready. The shrieking abomination craves for the blood of your enemies and is ready to fly you wherever you wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTMOUNTS.9.a;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_druchiiinv.20;With the Witch King gone, none of the Druchi despots seem to recognize you or anybody else as their new ruler. The mighty realm built around the immortal descendant of Aenarion has died with him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv.20;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_druchiiinv.21;With the Witch King gone, none of the Druchi despots seems to recognizing you or anybody else as their new ruler. It took centuries for Malekith to consolidate his rule by pitting the other Dark Elves one against the other. The natural consequences of his decisions are now falling upon you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv.21;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur52;Ulthuan has closed its borders. You can no longer enjoy its protection. On the other hand you are no longer obliged to pay tribute towards it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur52;Grim times indeed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai53;No cell will hold you as long as the great forces of Athel Loren are with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai53;The spirits freed me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai53005;Trying to hold the Avatar of Isha herself while inside Athel Loren was folly: the goddess has freed herself with the help of a legion of angered forest spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBasrai53005;Trying to hold the Avatar of Kurnous himself while inside Athel Loren was folly: the god has broken out of your boundaries with a horde of angry spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCasrai53005;Athel Loren is deeply connected with the forest spirits. The one you tried to hold slipped away, welcomed by the very ground of its homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai53005;Damnations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCshunters2;After much deliberation, the Council-Knights have decided who will take the mantle of Grand Master of the Templars of Sigmar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAshunters2;Finally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters1;As you're no longer capable of giving orders nor exact any of your duties, the other Masters have decided to relieve you of your position from within the Council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters1;Hnnnghllh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters10001;It was but a formality to convince the other Council-Knights of [From.GetFirstName]'s discharge. A new, better Templar will take [From.GetHerHis] place now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters10001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters2;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has accused you of bad conduct, reuniting the other Master Templars of the Council and claiming you are no longer fit to hold your current position within the holy congregation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters2;Absurd!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters20001;[FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has accused [From.GetTitledFirstName] of bad conduct, reuniting the other Master Templars of the Council and claiming [From.GetHerHim] to be unfit for duty. What is your opinion on the matter?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters20001;The accuse has merits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBswhunters20001;The accuse is baseless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAswhunters3;The Council has spoken: [From.GetTitledFirstName] has stained [From.GetHerHis] office with clumsiness and unholy conduct and must therefore be removed immediately, lest [From.GetSheHe] lead further corruption inside the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBswhunters3;The Council has spoken: [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s accuses are unfounded and every charge against [From.GetHerHim] should be lifted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters3;Burn [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBswhunters3;Exile it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCswhunters3;The accuser was obviously misled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters30001;The Council-Knights were on the side of the accuser. The Order has sentenced you to death by the stake for your unholy conduct, to cleanse the Temple from your stain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters30001;Arrrgh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters30002;The Council-Knights were on the side of the accuser. The Order has sentenced you to exile for your unholy conduct, you are to abandon your possessions and leave at once, never to return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters30002;You are mistaken!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters30003;Your work has been accomplished. The Council-Knights have recognized the righteousness of your charges and burned the vile apostate to cleanse the holy walls of the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters30003;Praised be Sigmar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters30004;Your work has been accomplished. The Council-Knights have recognized the righteousness of your charges and exiled the vile apostate forever from the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters30004;Yet the blasphemer still breathes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters30005;The Order does not make mistakes, clearly your accuser was the one being misled, for the Council-Knights have agreed upon your innocence of all charges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters30005;I never doubted the Order to see the Truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters30006;Some foul power must be aiding the blasphemer, for the Council-Knights could not see the unholiness beneath them and decided to drop your charges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters30006;There are no innocents!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters4;You feel that with the impending doom of Chaos looming over all, your life cannot have a meaning, if not pledged on the defense of the world against this deadly threat. You've decided to enter the Holy Order of the Templars of Sigmar and fight the wicked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters4;I'll ask my liege at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBswhunters4;Well, thinking back at it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters40001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has decided to leave and join the Witch Hunters, to fight corruption everywhere, pledging [From.GetHerHis] life to cleanse the enemies of humanity from the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters40001;Go in the light of Sigmar, [GetFromRelation].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBswhunters40001;Nonsense, I have plans for you here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters40002;Your [GetFromRelation] understood your request and decided to grant your wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters40003;Your [GetFromRelation] did not seem to understand nor share your concerns and denied you to leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters40003;But I could make a difference!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters5;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI write you in dire need of help. My realm is incurring in several expenses which go beyond the capacities of my treasury. I humbly ask your Order for support in these dark time, promising I'll soon be able to repay in full the sum requested.\n\nHumbly,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters5;Request granted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBswhunters5;The Order has no money to spare right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters50001;Most virtuous [Root.GetTitledFirstName], of course we, the Holy Order of the Templars of Sigmar, can lend you 500 gold. All that we ask in return is your future assistance in certain matters as they might arise. Sigmar protects,\n\nGrand Master [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters50002;Most virtuous [Root.GetTitledFirstName], sadly, I must decline your request of 500 gold. The Holy Order of the Templars of Sigmar is tangled in a never-ending battle agaisnt Chaos and such a war requires our every resource. Sigmar protects,\n\nGrand Master [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters50002;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters6;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI, humble servant of Sigmar, send you this small sum to aid you in your battle against corruption and to show my unrelenting support for the good and virtuous Templars of the Order.\n\nHumbly,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters60001;Most virtuous [Root.GetTitledFirstName], the Order gladly accepts your humble donation and takes note of your outstanding action for future reference,\n\nGrand Master [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters70001;Accursed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nYour attempts at obstructing our holy charge do nothing but confirm your wickedness. Be assured the Order shall not rest until your heresy has been exposed and the corruption in your realm wiped out through our Lord's blessed flames.\n\nBy the glory of Sigmar,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters70001;That went well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters70002;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nDespite your virtuous charge, I've found your Order's envoys to be nothing but agitators and murderers. Although this might be through none of your or your noble peers's fault, I see it no longer in my interest to allow the agents of the Order to roam within my realm.\n\nHumbly,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters70002;The slyness betrays [FromFrom.GetHerHis] heresy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters8;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI see now the error of our ways and desire to immediately make ammends for our past mistakes by opening once more my realm's gates to the Holy Order's agents, so that you may continue your righteous charge here.\n\nHumbly,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters80001;Most virtuous [Root.GetTitledFirstName], the Order is relieved of your wise decision. We shall soon send new agents in your court to root out whatever vile heresy has sprung in your realm during our absence and properly eradicate it,\n\nGrand Master [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters80001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters90003;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nOur agents have found interest and promise in  your [GetFromFromRelation]'s [FromFrom.GetFirstName] and, due to your existing dept towards the Order, we ask, in exchange for an extension to your charge, to receive [FromFrom.GetHerHim], to be trained as a Templar of the Order.\n\nSigmar's grace,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters13;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nAs you've yet to repay the Order for our generous loan to your treasury, we ask, in an exchange for an extension to your charge, to allow us to build a fortress in a province of our choosing within your borders.\n\nSigmar's grace,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters14;As agreed upon, a fortress has been built in [Root.GetName] to be garrisoned by the holy warriors of the Templar Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters18;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nWe've found a good area within your borders to build a fortress of the Order, from which to extend our protection against heresy and corruption. The Order humbly ask to receive permission to build such a fortress in your realm.\n\nSigmar's grace,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters19;As agreed upon, a fortress has been built in [Root.GetName] to be garrisoned by the holy warriors of the Templar Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters21;I require your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] for the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters21;Granted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBswhunters21;I'll pay my debt instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCswhunters21;Denied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters21001;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI am glad to allow [FromFrom.GetFirstName] to join the Holy Order of the Templars. May [FromFrom.GetSheHe] aid you well in your sacred quest against heresy and corruption.\n\nHumbly,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters21001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters21002;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nWhile I have no desire to go against the wishes of the Order, I understand this request comes from my upstanding debt towards your treasury, which I am now ready to pay in exchange for the future of [FromFrom.GetFirstName].\n\nHumbly,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters21002;Acceptable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters21003;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nWhile I have no desire to go against the wishes of the Order, I must deny this request, for [FromFrom.GetFirstName] is very dear to me and I would not want to be departed from [FromFrom.GetHerHim] at this time.\n\nHumbly,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters21003;Why? What depraved deed are they concocting?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters23;I require land in [From.GetName] to build a fortress for the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters23;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBswhunters23;I'll pay my debt instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCswhunters23;Denied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters23001;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI am glad to allow your Order to build an outpost within my borders. I am certain everyone will feel safer knowing that the Templars are protecting us.\n\nHumbly,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters23001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters23002;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nWhile I have no desire to go against the wishes of the Order, I understand this request comes from my upstanding debt towards your treasury, which I am now ready to pay in exchange for the land in [FromFrom.GetName].\n\nHumbly,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters23002;Acceptable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters23003;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nWhile I have no desire to go against the wishes of the Order, I must deny this request, for [FromFrom.GetName] is a precious part of my demesne and I'd not like to be departed from it.\n\nHumbly,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters23003;Why? What depraved acts are being performed there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters24;[Root.GetTitledName],\n\nThe Order of the Templars of Sigmar will not let you stand alone against the growing darkness. Hold steady, for we will come and bear the full might of our Lord upon your enemies.\n\nBy Sigmar's grace,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters24;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters240001;[Root.GetTitledName],\n\nThe Order of the Templars of Sigmar is sympathetic to your just cause, but cannot spare men at the time being to aid you in your war.\n\nSigmar protects,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters240001;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters25;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI beseech the Holy Order for assistance against most foul enemies I am assaulted from. This unholy creatures could certainly be no match for the Templars of Sigmar.\n\nHumbly,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDswhunters25;We shall join you at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCswhunters25;Not this time, sadly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters27;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nThe Holy Order of the Templars of Sigmar requires your compliance for an investigation within your borders. We are certain of the collaboration of any Sigmar-fearing good ruler.\n\nHumbly,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters27;Request granted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBswhunters27;I'd rather pay our standing debt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCswhunters27;Request denied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters27001;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI am glad to allow your agents to scour my lands. I am certain everyone will feel safer knowing that the Templars are protecting us.\n\nHumbly,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters27001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters27002;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nWhile I have no desire to go against the wishes of the Order, I understand this request comes from my upstanding debt towards your treasury, which I am now ready to pay in exchange for your discretion.\n\nHumbly,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters27002;Acceptable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters27003;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nWhile I have no desire to go against the wishes of the Order, I must deny this request. I assure you there is nothing wrong in my lands and your presence might do nothing but stir the peasants.\n\nHumbly,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters27003;Why? What depraved acts are being performed there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters28;Blessed brother [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nThe Order commands you to go on a mission to root out Chaos and depravity wherever you'll find them.\n\nSigmar be with you,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters28;So it shall be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters28001;After relentless days of work, the Witch Hunter sent by the Order has cleansed the province of [Root.GetName] of any wicked influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters28001;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters28002;Blessed [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nBy the grace of Sigmar, I have scoured these lands and brought swift justice upon any form of corruption and depravity I've there found. Do you wish me to proceed with my investigation at the court of the local lord or to return to the Temple?\n\nSigmar protects,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters28002;Go and burn any wicked soul you find.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBswhunters28002;Go and capture any wicked soul you find.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCswhunters28002;Your work is done, return to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters28003;Your suspicions might have been all too correct. Word is sent your agent [From.GetFirstName] has tragically and mysteriously disappeared in the province [From.GetSheHe] was sent to investigate upon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters28003;Something lurks there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters31;Blessed [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nSigmar be with you. I have completed my task, hunted down and publically executed all those who scourged these lands with sin, Grand Master. May the glorious light of Sigmar shine upon these lands once more.\n\nSigmar protects,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters31;Good. Return to us now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters32;Blessed [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nSigmar be with you. I have completed my task, hunted down and sent back to the Temple all those who were suspicious enough to be hiding corruption within them, Grand Master. May you judge them and bring an end to their vile ways.\n\nSigmar protects,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters32;Good. Return to us now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy40;You thought you could live with it, but never growing old, never being an adult has turned your unlife into a curse. Are you even meant to think these things? You are still a child, after all. You will always be a child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy40;I want new toys!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy41;Nothing, nothing excites you any longer. Your vampiric senses allow you to perceive any smell, any touch to its fullest, but you've satiated yourself with all the world had to offer to you. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy41;No! There must be something more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy42;All the people you care about grow old and die, the world has changed into a foreign and distasteful place, yet you're still the same, a relic of a past long gone, without any real purpose left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy42;Why do anything at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy43;It's a warm day and, even in your palace, you feel uncomfortable. You long for the cold embrace of your dear mother. Once you approach her to ask for some hours of cuddling, you also realize you feel somewhat hungry and your eyes fall eerily on her breasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy43;It's a warm day and, even in your palace, you feel uncomfortable. You long for the cold embrace of your dear mother. That is, if you add a proper one. Just like you, she's never grown old, to the point you have started doubting if she's your mother at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy43;Hug me, mommy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy43005;Your spawn, trapped in a childish body and devolved into a childish mind has come to you today, asking for some affection. As [From.GetSheHe] throws [From.GetHerHim]self on you, [From.GetHerHis] fangs already try and find a way towards your chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy43005;Today your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has come crying to you, saying you're not [From.GetHerHis] real mother, but rather a deceitful girl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy43005;Oh, alright then... But just this once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslunacy43005;Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslunacy43005;No, you're the only child!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy43006;Your mother spends almost the whole day rocking you on her lap, allowing you to suckle milk and blood from her breast until satiated. When you finally fall asleep, she carries you back to your coffin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy43006;Your mother spends almost the whole day rocking you on her lap, allowing you to suckle milk and blood from her breast until satiated. When you finally fall asleep, she carries you back to your coffin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy43006;And now you'll be my mum forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslunacy43006;We should do this more often, mum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy43007;Your mother refused your request, scolding you with some nonsense about being too old for what you asked for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy43007;But mum!..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy43008;You grab your child's hair, mocking [From.GetHerHim] for crying and starting to gleefully let [From.GetHerHim] chase you. You turn into fog, call for wolves to catch each other's scent, have undead fight for your wounded honor and finally and happily fall asleep together as the dawn approaches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy43008;Best time ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy44;It was already hard being with an eternal child, but recently your love has started to act more and more like one. You do not know how should you feel about your partner or how should you be together from further on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy44;It was already hard being with an eternal child, but recently your love has started to act more and more like one. It was a fun quirk at the beginning, like a proper aristocrat develops in its long life, but now it grow into an embarassement of sorts. You do not know how should you feel about your partner or how should you be together from further on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy44;I can't love a child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslunacy44;This was never about love anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslunacy44;Actually, this is kind of intriguing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy44001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been acting strangely lately, avoiding you all the time. When pressured, [From.GetFirstName] admitted that [From.GetSheHe] cannot love a child like you appear to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy44001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been acting strangely lately, avoiding you all the time. When pressured, [From.GetFirstName] admitted that your child-like behaviour embarrasses [From.GetHerHim] and doesn't want to have anything to do with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy44001;Fine! I don't want your cooties anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy44002;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been acting strangely lately, avoiding you all the time. Not that you really care about a grown-up like [From.GetHerHim], but it is annoying to not having [From.GetHerHim] around when you need [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy44002;I'm hungry! Fetch me someone to drink!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy44003;You felt a little weird when your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] shared bed with you today after so long. You weren't sure about it, but some of the funny things [From.GetSheHe] did with you were quite pleasing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy44003;Do we do it again tomorrow?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy45;The more you try new things to stimulate your senses, the more you grow accustomed to excesses and depravities. You have grown to have quite the reputation amongst your fellow aristocrats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy45;Who cares? I want more! I can barely feel anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy46;Your skin feels cold and stale, your mind is feverish for the need of new sensations. What can you do to appease your desire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy46;Cut the flesh, bring the pain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslunacy46;Feeding on life, what else could be more exilerating?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslunacy46;I need someone to sate this desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDslunacy46;Anything! Just... just anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy46001;What does it matter how deep you cut with your nails and fangs? You can already see your wounds healing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy46001;It's useless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy46002;You feed and feed upon a dozen or so different victims, some provided by the servants, some willingly submitting to your grasp. But even after you're wallowed in their blood, you feel nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy46002;More!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy46003;Blood is not enough to placate your desire, so you start taking pieces of meat from your victims as well, gorging on the flesh of the living against all your instincts. The repulsion you feel is dim, but at least it is something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy46003;More!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy46004;There's always some young thrall around, too young to have dignity, too eager to rise to care about shame, but ravaging their body gives you no pleasure. There is no itch, not the way the mortals feel, not way some of the other aristocrats claim to feel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy46004;Why can't I feel it!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy46005;You needed something different from another cold body to rub over yours, but the warmth of the servant you pinned on your bed does not make you feel any passion, just a mild annoying thirst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy46005;Always thirst, I hate it! Can't I feel ANYTHING ELSE!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy46006;A mortal is just some cattle, a vampire another cold body without any passion in it. You thought a ghoul would be the middle ground where you could find a little excitement, but the pitiful creature is nothing but cattle with a worse stench.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy46006;Grrrmmnhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy47007;Nobody understand what you need to feel anything, nobody knows how empty you are. You thought commanding an undead would give you something new and something that could push exactly as far as you ordered. But the shambling rotting body has no fire within it, all the actions you order it to take resonate hollow within your mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy47007;Useless sack of bones!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy47008;You dance around the shadow, looking at the first burns, then daring your eyes up in the clean sky. The rush of fear and repulsion runs through your body, shrieking for you to hide inside, but you move another step forward, inebriated by that terror and the smell of your own flesh burning under the sunlight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy47008;Ahhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy47009;The chains twist your limbs, while the hooks slowly tear out pieces of your flesh. Soon, the wounds will close and then the pain will go away, allowing that new sensation to come about, the weird feeling of having healed parts dislocated from their correct position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy47009;Ahhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy47010;The twin-tailed comet, the hammer of Sigmar, looking at them feels you with fear and just for that you feel compelled to go against your instincts and place your hands on the holy symbols, reveling on the pain and revulsion summoned by Nagash's curse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy47010;I can almost feel him chant the spell...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy47011;You take your arm out of the river, noting how the running water withered and corroded your perfect pale flesh. It is an intriguing sensation, one mortals could not describe. It is not like being burned, but it has a similar effect. As you watch your exposed bones, you immerse the arm once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy47011;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy48;There is nothing and no-one for you to live for anymore. And yet, you remain in this eternal life, condemned to live until after the end of times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy48;Why can't I die?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy49;There was a time when you were a greater person. When your servants knew how to properly respect their betters, when you could dream of conquests and exquisite endeavors. Yet it is all gone, your life now but a hollow memory of what it was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy49;The past... is all I have left...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy49001;You feel like the world holds no interest for you anymore. You have no longer place in it and thus, you slowly fall into hibernation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy49001;I'll dream of what was...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy49005;You suddenly feel something, as if the unlife as unmoving corpse could be worst of what you left, however little it was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy49005;It is time to wake! I am back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslunacy49005;No... no... I will sleep, for now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires16;The dreaded Red Duke has risen once again, to claim his rule over Aquitaine and all of Bretonnia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires16;Follow me to war, brothers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires16;I will bide my time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires17;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has gathered new fledglings to increase the size of [From.GetHerHis] host, bringing prestige to your name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires17;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires18;In your long quest for perfection you've defeated countless enemies and ravaged entire provinces. In this search, your men collected several trinkets. It is only right to send some of them to the Master of your Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires18;They have no value to me anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires18005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has quested long and hard, honing [From.GetHerHis] skills in [From.GetHerHis] search for perfection. Although of little value to your Order, [From.GetSheHe] has sent part of [From.GetHerHis] spoils of war as tribute in your honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires18005;Trinkets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires19001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has tricked you: the fiend is nothing but a Prince of Darkness and has now taken [event_target:eloper.GetFirstName] away from you, turning it into an unliving abomination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsvampires19001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has tricked you, the vampire has seen something in [event_target:eloper.GetFirstName] and snatched [event_target:eloper.GetHerHim] away from you, turning it into [From.GetHerHis] fledgling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires19001;[From.GetSheHe] could have asked...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires19001;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires19002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has found some young talented mortal to join From.GetHerHis] ranks and turned the human into another member of the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires19002;It better be very talented.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires20;The Blood Dragons have deployed their mindless and relentless servants to permanently occupy the province of [Root.GetName], if the county is not freed soon, a new enemy fortress shall rise within your very borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires20;They must be stopped!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires21;The Blood Dragons in [Root.GetName], have completed their work: a dreaded fortress stands within your lands, housing new undead forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires21;Damnations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FLIGHTS_OF_DEVILS;Flights of Devils;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCMOUNTS.11;A Knight as powerful as you are deserves a mighty steed to go with [Root.GetHerHim]. You may embark in a short quest to find your very own Nightmare to ride, although it might keep you away for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCMOUNTS.12;There it is, a dark and twisted form, gallopping through the somber clouds of a stormy night, your new steed. It is finally time to go back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BLOOD_QUEST_TITLE;The Blood Quest;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons22;It is decided. You send word through your hold so that all those armed with bravery, skill and craving for perfection be called to ride at your side in this great quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons22;We march at sunset!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons23;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI call you, who claim to have valor and skill, to join me in a daring quest ashore. We shall fight and kill, laying waste upon unworthy weaklings, reveling in the thrill of the hunt and the challenge of good game.\n\nWill you be with us?\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons23;I'll ready my steed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsblooddragons23;I'm busy right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons23001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has joined you in your quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons23001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons24;It has been a good sport, but it has now come the time for you to go home and meditate on your accomplishments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons24;We've had a good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons24001;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI feel tired from all this aimless slaughter and have come to the decision of leaving this host. When you'll receive this message I'll be long gone and on my way home.\n\nGood hunting\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons24001;Bah, spineless scum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons24002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to put an end to your Quest. The Blood Dragons, satiated with blood and wantom slaughter, finally return to their hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons24002;We've had a good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons25001;With [From.GetTitledFirstName] dead, the Blood Quest is without a leader. One by one, the knights disband, returning to their hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons25001;It was good while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons26001;With [From.GetTitledFirstName] captured and beyond reach, the Blood Quest is without a leader. One by one, the knights disband, returning to their hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons26001;It was good while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27;Do you wish to remain in this land, or venture forth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27;There's still much to be killed here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsblooddragons27;Yes, let us ride away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27001;Where would you like to ride your knights?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27001;North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsblooddragons27001;East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsblooddragons27001;West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsblooddragons27001;South.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to move the Blood Quest in the old Imperial lands, hoping for the vast armies and the relentless Witch Hunters to put up a worthy challenge to your blades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27002;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27003;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to move the Blood Quest in the restless Border Princedoms. The countless armies of petty warlords and greenskin savages should provide a good sport for all of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27003;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27004;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to move the Blood Quest to the snowy plains of Kislev, hoping to track down some of the northern great beasts or find good sport in one of the nomadic tribes roaming the borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27004;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to move the Blood Quest to Bretonnia. The fierce and fearless knights of the Lady are sure to put up a worthy challenge to the Knights of Abhorash.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27005;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27006;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to move the Blood Quest to the southern realms of Myrmidia. These warm plains scourged by discontented peasants and petty Princes could hold a proper challenge for all of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27006;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27007;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to move the Blood Quest to the ancient borders of Strygos. This barren wasteland scourged by greenskins and other pathetic creatures will crumble under your hooves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27007;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27008;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to move the Blood Quest to Araby, a land of mystics, scourging hot sun and vast deserts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27008;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27009;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to move the Blood Quest to the mysterious lands of Nehekhara, the ancestral home of all Vampires. Once more, the descendants of Lahmia will fight against the rotting corpses of Khemri.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27009;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27010;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to move the Blood Quest to cold shores of Norsca, riddled with hordes of superstitious and warmongering barbarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27010;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27011;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to lead the host beneath the ground, exploring the long-abandoned underground tunnels of the Dwarfs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27011;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27012;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to lead the host in the far East, exploring the goblin-riddled plains known as Darklands, where only the merciless fist of the Dawi Zharr stands against unfettered anarchy and destruction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27012;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27013;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to lead the host in the ancestral homeland of the Elves, Ulthuan. The elusive island, protected by ancient spells and defended by skilled elven warriors is sure to put up a fearsome fight against your incursion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27013;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27014;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to lead the host in the deadly and poisonous jungles of Lustria. All sorts of exotic and dangerous creatures crawl under the tight leaves of this ancient land, each would make an excellent game for any of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27014;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27015;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to lead the host to the Land of the Chill, home to the cruel Dark Elves. Skilled in magic and murder, the Druchii are certain to be a great challenge for your blades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27015;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27016;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to lead the host to the intricate and mysterious forest of Athel Loren. Strange and unknowable creatures hide between those ancient trees and the elusive Wood Elves are known to fiercely defend them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27016;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27017;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to lead the host to the ultimate challenge and ride into the Polar Wastes themselves, where the stuff of Chaos pours freely into reality and it's given claws and hunger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27017;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27018;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to lead the host oversea, challenging the great ocean to reach strange and new challenge for you to meet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27018;We soar in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons29;There was no doubt about it from hours before you finally sight the warband in the distance: greenskins. Their stench filled your blackened lungs from miles away. There's hardly any test of resolution against a bloodless foe, but they should at least put up a decent fight for your host.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29;Let's prepare for battle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsblooddragons29;We'll ride around, they're not worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons29001;Your leader has caught the scent of a greenskin band and decided to engage them. There's hardly any test of resolution against a bloodless foe, but they should at least put up a decent fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29001;I'll partake in this skirmish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsblooddragons29001;This is beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons29002;The greenskins are still far away, you're quite certain their dim senses have yet to allow them to perceive you. The orcs and goblins are marching in the distance, moving from a hill towards your host and outnumber you greatly, but their brute force should be no match for your knights' skill and determination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29002;I shall fly and lead a strike on them from above.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsblooddragons29002;We can lure them down before attacking and half their advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsblooddragons29002;We will flank them and crush them from the sides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsblooddragons29002;We will charge them in a frontal assault.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsblooddragons29003;[From.GetTitledFirstName] calls you and the other knights for an aeral assault on the greenskins. You spur your winged steed, following [From.GetHerHis] lead. You fall down upon the unsuspecting orcs, trampling and slashing greenskins left and right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsblooddragons29003;[From.GetTitledFirstName] calls some of the knights for an aeral assault on the greenskins. As for you and the other land-bound knights, you have to join the fray later on, charging the greenskins as they are caught by surprise from above.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29003;Die, foul creatures!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons29004;You fly off with some of the nights, while the others await down for the signal. Soaring beyond the clouds, with sunlight boiling over your stealplate, you dive down onto the greenskins, trampling them and slashing their stiff flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29004;Your end has come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsblooddragons29005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sends you with half of the knights ahead to lure the greenskins down. It's not hard to taunt the beasts into charging down the hill. Once they lose their momentum, [From.GetFirstName] springs the ambush, charging out of the slope as you turn to face the savages as well, along with the rest of your group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29005;Stupid savages, your end is nigh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons29006;You send half of the host ahead, taunting the orcs to charge down the hill while you find cover behind a slope. It's not hard for the others to taunt them in a charge and once the greenskins have lost their momentum, you come out of your hiding spot, leading an assault from behind them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29006;Stupid savages, your end is nigh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsblooddragons29007;[From.GetTitledFirstName]divides the host, ordering a charge from the sides, to flank and crush the pathetic greenskins. The orcs spot you as you ride over the hill, roaring in anticipation for the fight, carelessly running towards both parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29007;Mindless beasts, die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons29008;You divide the host, ordering a charge from the sides, to flank and crush the pathetic greenskins. The orcs spot you as you ride over the hill, roaring in anticipation for the fight, carelessly running towards both parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29008;Mindless beasts, die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsblooddragons29009;[From.GetTitledFirstName] shouts, calling for a frontal charge against the greenskin foe. You spur your steed uphill, quickly gaining thrust alongside the other knights and smashing into the gleeful horde of orcs and goblins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29009;DIE!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons29010;You shout, calling for a frontal charge against the greenskin foe. You spur your steed uphill, quickly gaining thrust alongside the other knights and smashing into the gleeful horde of orcs and goblins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29010;DIE!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsblooddragons29011;Dozens of orcs fall before the greenskin's thirst for battle is overcome by their cowardice. The broken remnants of the warband flee back towards the hill, trying to escape the cold steel of your lances and swords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29011;Pursue them, wipe that pathetic scum from the face of the Earth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsblooddragons29011;Pursue and capture those wreck for our amusement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsblooddragons29011;Let the weak flee before our might! We're done here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsblooddragons29012;One after the other, you cut down the pitiful greenskins, but their numbers and determination are too great: the savages keep on fighting, slowly turning the tide. Finally, your steed falls over, cut down by dozen of goblins and a huge orc bears his hammer down upon your face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29012;No!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsblooddragons29013;Dozens of orcs fall before the greenskin's thirst for battle is overcome by their cowardice. The broken remnants of the warband flee back towards the hill, trying to escape the cold steel of your lances and swords. [From.GetFirstName] finally declares victory, standing upon their broken carcasses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29013;Yahh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsblooddragons29014;You knights have an easy time reaching and cutting down the remainder of the warband. Their heads roll down the hill, cementing your ultimate victory over this foe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29014;None stands in the way of the Blood Dragons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsblooddragons29015;Despite their zeal, your knights can only take some of the cowards' lives before the orcs finally disappear in a nearby wood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29015;Pests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsblooddragons29016;Once the  survivors are rounded up, you spend a couple of hours having your fun torturing a few. A couple of them, perhaps believing a purpose to be in your entertainment, shout the name of some stashed loot nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29016;Deluded fools. Still, no reason to let it waste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires23;Just like moths circling towards the light, a band of ghouls and minor undead has shambled its way to your dominion, instinctively seeking the guide of an aristocrat of the night such as yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires23;More servants are always welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires23;Those revolting carcasses are beneath my needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_svampires.26;You've waited too long. The adventurers and nomadic Strygan tribes gathered under your banner have slowly lost interest and left, leaving you with too little troops to attempt the reconquest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_svampires.26;You've waited too long. The shambling bands of ghouls gathered under your will have devolved into petty infighting out of starvation, tearing each other apart to the point you have too little troops to attempt an invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.26;Next time... next time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_svampires.27;A great caravan comes into your capital, led by several warriors of the Badlands who heard of your plans and have decided to join you on your quest for your old homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_svampires.27;Slowly but surely a great deal of ghouls has started to flock the lands over your cove, lured by the silent call they cannot resist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires.27;Come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_svampires.28;Your name is well remembered by the old aristocrats of Strygos and, albeit your bloodline is by nature reclusive, your renown was enough to lead another Strigoi to your cove, ready to pledge allegiance to you and follow you in your conquest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_svampires.28;Your name is well remembered by the old aristocrats of Strygos and, albeit your bloodline is by nature reclusive, your renown was enough to lead another Strigoi to your cove, ready to pledge allegiance to you and follow you in your conquest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires.28;Welcome, brother.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_svampires.29;Little by little, warriors and adventurers have come to your capital, eagerly awaiting for the war to reclaim their ancestors's homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_svampires.29;Little by little, the ghouls and Strigany come to you, flocking your land and awaiting your command to march against the usurpers of your ancestral realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires.29;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires31;You never doubted it, you knew this day would have come, you knew you would have been the one to reclaim Strygos. With the core regions firmly under your control, nobody can deny your great empire is nearly restored. The hordes of savage greenskins and the pitiful armies of the mortals or the trickery of the accursed Lahmians could do nothing but slow down the inevitable.\n\n Strygos has returned to life, with you as its rightful monarch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires31;I am victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires31001;Only legends talk about the wonders and the greatness of old Strygos. Never you could have dreamed one such as yourself could restore the realm of the immortals. And yet, here you are, holding the power once kept by the Tomb Princes, now wrestled by your hand from the savage greenskins.\n\n Strygos has risen once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires31001;A new age starts for our people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires310002;Despite your trickery and plots, the pitiful humans descendants of the old Strygos have reclaimed their homeland, one of them even having the gall to call [From.GetHerHim]self King of that accursed and misforgotten realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsvampires310002;For millennia the Lahmians has hindered and hunted down the pathetic remnants of Ushoran's bloodline and yet the Strigoi have finally prevailed: a perveted flesh-eater rules over the Badlands, fancying [From.GetHerHim]self monarch of Strygos. Never were you so angered and embarassed at your failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires310002;Curse them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires310003;You had long dreamed for this moment, yet the resurgence of Strygos couldn't have come from a more unexpected source: it was not one of Ushoran's bloodline, but a humble mortal, a wandering Strigany, to restore the old realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsvampires310003;You had long dreamed for this moment and although you'd have wished to be the one restoring Strygos, you can find solance knowing the blood of Ushoran reigns once more in Morukain, demanding the proper respect over all the Badlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires310003;I wish to join this Strygos reborn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires310003;This is but another fleeting dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires32;A great caravan of Strigany has come to the gates of your capital. Although the gypsies wear strange clothes and talk a strange dialect, they seem quiet and well-intentioned. They bring weird craft and exotic spices from afar to be sold within your walls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires32;They are welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires32;I don't want their kind here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires32001;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] has returned empty-handed from the expedition. It appears none of the lands [FromFrom.GetSheHe] visited would welcome Strigany merchants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires32001;Drats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires32002;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI bring good tidings from [From.Location.GetName], we've been accepted by the locals and started selling our wares. \n\nI've sent some of our profit along with this missive\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires32002;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires32003;Your merchants have sold lots of wares and made good profit this season. You will be greatly welcomed as you return to your liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires32003;Let's ride home, friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires33003;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI bring you great wealth and craft [From.Location.GetName], where our merchants have sold most of our products this season. \n\nAs customary, I bring forth your share of the profits\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires33003;Good. Keep travelling there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires33003;This will be enough for that place. I want you here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires33;The Strigany merchants have packed their tents and removed themselves from your capital, probably for good this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires33;It was about time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires32004;Your merchants have sold some wares and made a decent profit this season. You will be welcomed as you return to your liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires32004;Let's ride home, friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires34004;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI bring you wealth and craft [From.Location.GetName], where our merchants have sold a good part of our products this season. \n\nAs customary, I bring forth your share of the profits\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires34004;Good. Keep travelling there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires34004;This will be enough for that place. I want you here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires32005;There has been a series of accidents and misunderstanding earning you the hate of the locals. You've had therefore not make good profit this season.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires32005;Drats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires35004;There's been some miscontent within your capital in the past few months. The locals seem to have grown tired of the Strigany wandering about their homes, taking up their places in the market and, according to some reports, performing dark rituals in the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires35004;Those gypsies are nothing but trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires35005;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI regret to inform you our travel to [From.Location.GetName] has not been as successful as expected. A series of accidents and misunderstandings have earned us the hate of the locals, making it difficult for our merchants to sell their wares. \n\nPerhaps it might be better to change our destination for the next season\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires35005;No, keep travelling there. They'll get used to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires35005;A good suggestion. Stay here for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires32006;The bigotry and hate of the locals drove them to openly attack your merchants. You are forced to return home without any of your products sold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires32006;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires36004;The people in the capital have grown tired of the Strigany. Made fearful by their strange customs and dark rituals, they've risen up and openly attacked the merchants, driving them away from your city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires36004;Probably it's for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires36006;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI regret to inform you our travel to [From.Location.GetName] has been ill-fated. The locals, enflamed by our mere appearance, have driven us out of the city in a few days, preventing us from selling any of our wares. \n\nWe are no longer welcomed in this realm for some time,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires36006;That's inconvenient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires32007;Your great skills as a leader and a merchant has led your caravan to build a proper colony in these lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires32007;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires37007;Your leniency in the past years might have been ill-advised. The community of Strigany has become so large to have claimed some of your lands, building a stable tribe there from which their caravans pass through each season.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires37007;That's... not something I ordered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires37008;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nOur perseverance has paid off. No longer we are mere travellers in [From.Location.GetName] a stable Strygan outpost has been built in the past years as more of our people flocked in to share in our profits.\n\nWe pledge ourselves under your protection as I take charge of this post, with your blessing,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires37008;Great news indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires38;With Strygos reformed, you have the chance to restore the old Kingdom to its true glory. Should you push for the return of the old laws and customs?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires38;Yes, Strygos shall be as it were.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires38;No, this is a new Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires39;The Strigany in [Root.GetName] have slowly settled permanently in their old lands, taking the old customs of their forefathers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires39;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires40;More Strigany are flocking every month in [Root.GetName], colonizing once more their ancestral homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires40;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires43;Your minions have broken the defenses of [From.GetName]. Even now they move forward to round up the local population. What should be done with the mortals?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires43;Kill them all. Destroy everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires43;They'll make good subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires43;I do not care about these.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires44;[From.GetFirstName] has sent [From.GetHerHis] vile minions to destroy the province of [FromFrom.GetName], leaving nothing but tainted rubble, marked with the repulsive stench of undeath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires44;Blasted abominations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires45;[From.GetFirstName] has sent [From.GetHerHis] vile minions to destroy the province of [FromFrom.GetName], kidnapping dozens of families to be subjected to [From.GetHerHis] vile experiments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires45;Blasted abominations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires46;[From.GetFirstName] has sent [From.GetHerHis] vile minions to destroy the province of [FromFrom.GetName], many of the survivors of the attack are already flocking your gates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires46;Blasted abominations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires47;You have some spare subjects in your dungeons. How would you employ them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires47;They are good samples for my personal studies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires47;They can be repurposed to serve me forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires47;Keep them there for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires47001;As the blood of the last subject runs dry, you have concluded one of the most successful sessions of study you've had in quite some time. Experimenting on the pitiful mortals has given you a deeper understanding of the dark art of Nagash.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires47001;Another good night of work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires47002;Subject after subject, you twist and break the bodies and souls of your victims, looking at their entrails, recording the pitch of their screams, trying and dispelling incantations one after the other. In the end, you feel satisifed with your results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires47002;Another good night of work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires47003;Subject after subject, you twist and break the bodies and souls of your victims, looking at their entrails, recording the pitch of their screams, trying and dispelling incantations one after the other. The results might not be as good as you hoped for, but you're still adequately satisfied with yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires47003;Another good night of work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires47004;Subject after subject, you twist and break the bodies and souls of your victims, looking at their entrails, recording the pitch of their screams, trying and dispelling incantations one after the other. Sadly, this batch of mortals was not as enlightening as one would have hoped and your night ends in mild frustration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires47004;Next time will be better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires47005;Once you're done with them, the resulting minions have no resemblance to the subjects they once were. Such was the power and the skill you put on your work, they've been utterly transformed into loyal and terrifying creatures of the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires47005;Magnificent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires47006;You've had to discard several damaged subjects, but those who survived have now no resemblance to the subjects they once were. Such was the power and the skill you put on your work, they've been utterly transformed into loyal and terrifying creatures of the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires47006;Magnificent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires47007;Your original draft might have been too ambitious or, more likely, your subjects defective. The result of your experiment was a pack of ravenous and gibberish humanoids, still useful in a way, but nothing as grand and terrifying as you hoped for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires47007;Next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires47008;Your original draft might have been too ambitious or, more likely, your subjects defective. None of them managed to stay alive until the end. They'll at least be decent undead slaves, if nothing else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires47008;Better than nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires49;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent some of [From.GetHerHis] minions pleading for you to put your vast magical expertise into [From.GetHerHis] temporary employ and craft a magic item for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires49;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires49;I do not make trinckets for ones such as you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires50;[From.GetFirstName] has decided it would not be in [From.GetHerHis] best interest to craft a magic item for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires50;Drats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown1;You've chosen as your target one of the greatest servants of Khorne, a terrible creature moulded for war. A Daemon Prince will be a dangerous and terrible foe to fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBhuntdown1;You've chosen as your target one of the greatest servants of Nurgle, a gelatinous blob of pestilence and decay, corrupting anything that touches. A Daemon Prince will be a dangerous and terrible foe to fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCChuntdown1;You've chosen as your target one of the greatest servants of Slaanesh, an eerie and depraved creature, filled with cruelty and desire. A Daemon Prince will be a dangerous and terrible foe to fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDhuntdown1;You've chosen as your target one of the greatest servants of Tzeentch, a shapeshifting incomprehensible being, filled with the destructive power of Chaos. A Daemon Prince will be a dangerous and terrible foe to fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEhuntdown1;You've chosen as your target one of the mysterious wood spirits who rest in the twilight glades of Athel Loren. The forest itself will be a guardian to the creature, alongside any living thing around it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCGhuntdown1;You've chosen as your target one of the ancient sleeping rulers of the Lizardmen, said to wield the oldest and most powerful form of magic, learned directly from the Old Ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHhuntdown1;You've chosen as your target one of the old vampires. Unlike the Carsteins and their ilk, this creature lurks alone in the shadows, hidden by traps, magic and mindless servants, barely ever seeing the living.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIhuntdown1;You've chosen as your target one of the Princes of Darkness. Despite their many mundane weaknesses, vampires are a dangerous opponent, infused by unnatural senses and strength and gifted with natural dark magic. Killing one won't be easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown1;I will fell the monster myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBhuntdown1;I will search for somebody competent for this quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTChuntdown1;I'll bide my time for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChuntdown1001;You've prepared an expedition to kill your target, but still need a skilled fighter to lead it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown1001;I'll send my Marshal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBhuntdown1001;A Witch Hunter is what we need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTChuntdown1001;One of our wizards will succeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDhuntdown1001;I'd better wait some more first...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChuntdown1002;My most trusted friend,\n I hereby summon you to embark on a quest to fell a vile creature troubling my sleep. Should you accept and succeed, you will earn my eternal gratitude.\n\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown1002;I'll go at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBhuntdown1002;Hum... no thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChuntdown1003;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]\n I am honored by your invitation. I will depart at once to rid the world of this creature.\n\nBest regards,\n [Root.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown1003;Good, now it's out of my hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChuntdown1004;I'm sorry to inform you a grave business has come up in my household, requiring my immediate attention. I am therefore obliged to decline your prestigious invitation.\n\nRegards\n [Root.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown1004;I'll have to wait some more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown2;The great hall of the Daemon Prince of Khorne, your target, is a brass palace, stained with blood and decorated with thousands of skulls and bones from its many victims. How should you approach it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBhuntdown2;The great hall of the Daemon Prince of Nurgle, your target, is a desolate sanctuary, wrapped in a sickly yellowish miasma, charged with countless diseases. How should you approach it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCGhuntdown2;You've reached the great piramid of your target, the ancient Slann. The creature is likely sleeping within, but there is no telling what traps and spells it has wrapped around the building. Or how many Skinks are guarding it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHhuntdown2;You've reached the dark cove of the ancient vampire you hunt for. The green moon is clouded and only a few stars glitter the nightsky. Perhaps this might not be the right moment to push forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIhuntdown2;You've reached the gloomy palace of the vampire you seek to destroy. It is a clouded night and you can hear the crackling sound of the undead's bones in the courtyard. How should you proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTBhuntdown2;We wait for dawn. Then sneak in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAhuntdown2101;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown2999;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was not up to the challenge, it seems. You've received news of [From.GetHerHis] death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown2999;I'll have to wait for another chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown2102;[From.GetFirstName] has unleashed [From.GetHerHis] deadly power to try and burn you and your companions alive. You've barely survived, but not without grievous injuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown2102;Hnnnmpf..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown2103;The hellhounds of the Daemon Prince are after your squad, yelling and growling, their echoes reverbering on the metallic walls of the sanctuary. You can see the Daemon awaiting, swords at hand, on its throne, but you must get through its minions first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBhuntdown2103;Nurglings crawls all over your bodies, trying to sink their infective teeth in your flesh, as you slowly advance in the miasmic swamp. It is only after a while you realize the hill ahead of you is really the Daemon Prince of Nurgle, awaiting to embrace you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCChuntdown2103;Demented sycophants hurl themselves at you, piercing and pulling your skin with hooks and chains. You've slowly made your way through the labyrintine palace, but have yet to reach the depraved servant of Slaanesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDhuntdown2103;The very floor and walls shift at your steps, trying to grab and cut you and your followers in pieces. You feel you're closer to the center of madness, the Daemon Prince of Tzeentch, but have yet to pierce through its spells and illusions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCFhuntdown2103;The forest has risen against you. Dryads and saplings slow your advance towards the Spirit's glade, while hidden Asrai target you from afar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGhuntdown2103;Every step upwards a new trap triggers, a new spell falls down upon your men, cutting down your numbers. Yet, your evermore closer to the top, where the Slann awaits in sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHhuntdown2103;The hordes of ghouls and other undead monstrosities are blocking your path downards, but you still keep fighting through, knowing every fallen rotten corpse is a step closer to your quarry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIhuntdown2103;The enthralled guards and undead minions of the vampire have come to block your way. You must fight your way through the palace to reach your quarry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown2103;Forward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown2104;Your rush towards your target has not been successfull. You're the last to fall. When you awake, your corpse has been thrown outside. Albeith you've risen again, your mission has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown2104;I'll have revenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown2105;Your rush towards your target has not been successfull. You're the last to fall, marking the end of your quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAhuntdown2201;You've made your way through the obstacles put in your way by your quarry, now it's time to fell the beast itself and be done with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown2201;Face me, creature!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown3001;The Chaos God of War and Violence will have another reason to distaste magic today. Thanks to your spells, you've managed to foil the outer defences of the Daemon Prince and appeared right in its sanctum, before it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBhuntdown3001;With your magic you've surpassed undetected the halo of sickness and crawling horrors defending the sanctuary of the Nurglite Prince and are now before it, ready to kill the monster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCGhuntdown3001;The magic of the Old Ones is not something easy to pass through, yet today you've achieved such a feat, reaching unscathed the top of the piramid. The Slann is inside, fluctuating atop the ground, in his eternal sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCBhuntdown3101;The old vampire gives out a silent scream as you plunge the stake in its heart, trapping the creature, and cut its head off with your blade. You put the foul corpse on fire and finally leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAhuntdown3999;The beast is dead. You can rest easy now, knowing its foul presence no longer threatens you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown3999;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown4001;The Daemon Prince strikes at you, holding a firey whip in a hand and a screaming sword in the other, taunting and insulting each of you. The time has come for the final fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBhuntdown4001;The Daemon Prince stands over you, smiling and protrunding its arms, to welcome you in its pestilential embrace. Its mere stench is enough to make some of your comrades puke. The time has come for the final fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCChuntdown4001;The Daemon Prince laughs and leaps at you, fangs and claws ahead, trying to reach your eyes and face.. The time has come for the final fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCGhuntdown4001;The Slann opens its bulbous eyes, raising its skeletrical arms to form the first magical wards in the air as it prepares to unleash the wrath of the Old Ones upon you. The time has come for the final fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAhuntdown4001;I will destroy you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown4002;With an explosion of blood and splinters the Daemon Prince of Khorne is finally destroyed. Its disembowed skeleton screams and keeps on fighting still for a while, enveloped in a dark unnatural fire, until it consumes itself entirely, leaving no trace of the wicked creature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBhuntdown4002;Cut from a thousand wounds, the bloated body of the Nurglite Prince starts flushing out a torrent of pus and mucus, slowly crumbling on itself. You finally manage to crawl on its back and reach the head of the daemon, plunging your blade within its mouth. The Daemon Prince liquifies, living nothing but a pool of toxic waste beneath it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCChuntdown4002;With many of its arms and spines maimed, the Daemon Prince of Slaanesh is finally cornered. The survivors of your squad plunge their spears into its head and chest, disregarding its chuckled and incessant moaning, until the creature finally turns into porcelain and falls into pieces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDhuntdown4002;The more it becomes desperate and hurt, the more the Daemon Prince uses its magic to teleport to a safer place within the hall, always pursued by your comrades.

EVTDESCFhuntdown4002;Hacked down piece by piece, the forest spirit finally crumbles down with one last saddened moan. You order your men to keep on hacking, until every piece of it has been reduced to splinters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGhuntdown4002;With one final whimper, the Slann splatters on the walls of the piramid, thorn apart by the Winds of Magic in its final attempt to defend itself from you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHhuntdown4002;The monstrous vampire falls back, trying to flee in a cloud of fog, deadly injured by your fighters, but you're quicker than the creature and manage to stop it by stabbing its heart. Now immobilized, the vampire is easily disposed of by the rest of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAhuntdown4003;One by one your companions are ripped into shreds by your foe. The monster mercilessly kills you, tossing away your remains. When you awake, you are outside the creature's lair. You might live again, but you've failed your quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAhuntdown4004;One by one your companions are ripped into shreds by your foe. The monster mercilessly kills you, tossing away your remains. Your quest is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown4004;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown4100;The adventurers who infiltrated your lair have cornered you. You fight savagely against them, but it is of no avail. In the end, their leader gives the final strike which kills you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown4100;Naaaannhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown4101;The adventurers who infiltrated your lair finally come to face you directly, they are fierce, but they could do nothing against a creature such as yourself and are obliterated one by one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown4101;Ah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmens1;Every once in a century, when the stars are aligned, the Spawning Pools give birth to just one Skink, gifted with the power of the Ancients. This is such a day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCslizardmen8;Your long search for ancient artifacts on behalf of your superior has almost cost you your life today, when you've been attacked by a pack of young wild naggaronts, barely escaping along your entourage of Sauri.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAMEslizardmen11;The Fragment;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen11;By the will of the Old Ones, your hard search has finally given its result: you've found a fragment of one of the ancient tablets of the Creators, whose translation will allow the Lizardmen to better fulfill their ultimate task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAslizardmen16;Monstrous savages!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen17;You shamed the Creators: the tribute reaped from your enemies is not sufficient to perform a proper ceremony. Your miscalculation in this war is a clear sign you acted against the perfection of the Great Plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen17;The prisoners have been rounded up beneath the great temples of the Old Ones. Whom will you dedicate your sacrifice to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen17;Imposssible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTCslizardmen17;The Benevolent Protector Quetzzl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDslizardmen17;The Myssteriousss Xholankha.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEslizardmen17;The Ravenouss Sssotek!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen19;A Mage-Priest died under your care! This cannot be part of the Great Plan, your gross inefficency in the most holy of the tasks shows your being to be defective beyond measure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen19;No no no no no no no!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen20;A Mage-Priest died under the care of one of your appointed chiefs! This cannot be part of the Great Plan, the gross inefficency of your helper in the most holy of the tasks shows your being also to be seriously defective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen20;Sssshh.. How could it be!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen21;The other Lizardmen do not understand your motives, they do not understand your behavior, so far it is removed from the Great Plan and the legacy of the Slann. It is common knowledge amongst the Skink that you emerged from your spawning pool somewhat defective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen21;Nonsssensse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22;You boast about your personal accomplishments and crave for more glory at each step of the journey. Too close you associate yourself with what should be the design of the Old Ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22;I am jussst overzealouss in my tasskss..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22001;You keep in your place and dulyfully perform your tasks. Truly, you are a productive and gregarious servant, working for the fruition of the Old Ones' Great Plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22001;I belong to the Creatorsss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22002;You keep missing work, underperforming, trying to constantly avoid responsibility. The Creators designed the Skinks to be loyal and productive servants, to behave as irresponsibly as you do is to go against your very nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22002;Jussst a minute to ressst, no?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22003;You work tirelessly and always crave for more tasks to be completed. Truly, you are a paragon of what it means to be a Skink: productive and efficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22003;I work for the Great Plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22004;You are always quick to anger, ready to act violently against whatever presents to be an issue to yourself. Such a behavior could be forgivable in a Saurus, but a Skink is not made for violence and such outburst can only hint to some inherent deviance in your soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22004;Well, ssscrew YOU!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22005;You always keep a cooler blood than any of your peers and approach all your troubles with a calm and rational mind. Thus is what a Skink should be and you cannot fail to set a great example for all the younger spawns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22005;Good, good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22006;A Skink should always act and speak openly to his spawn siblings. Your honesty and clarity can only quicken the achievement of the Great Plan through cohordinated effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22006;Liess are uselesss in the face of the Old Onesss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22007;Your deceptive nature is a deviance and a frustration for all other Skinks around you. The Old Ones made you to cohoperate and work together, but your deceptions make you unreliable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22007;It isss sstill for the greater good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22008;You like the glittering of gold and to keep such trinkets for yourself, but what does gold matter to the Ancients? Only lesser races, the savage mammals, should find any sort of solance by staring at a shiny useless metal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22008;But.. but.. it'ss sssso pretty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22009;You find an unhealthy joy in giving away trinkets and resources to those around you, even though the legacy of the Old Ones is neither cheap not to be squandered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22009;Ssshould it be let to wassste?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22010;You rarely know fear and gladly throw yourself in battle, this would be expected from a Saurus, but Skinks are made to be stewards and workers, not warriors. Your lack of fear might cloud your judgement and cause you to rush to a miscalculated action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22010;Doess it matter, if I win?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22011;You trust in the Old Ones and spend all your waking thoughts on how to better serve them and quicken the achievement of the Great Plan. All Skinks look up to you as a paragon of zealotry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22011;The Old Ones are with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22012;Your lack of faith in the design of the Old Ones is abhorrent. Nothing should be more important than understanding and achieving the Great Plan, yet you often find yourself wasting thoughts on other frivolous matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22012;There'sss more to thiss life than the Great Plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen23001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] agrees with your interpretation of the will of [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen23002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] disagrees with your interpretation: that's not what [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen24;The clerks rush into your hall, screaming in discomfort: [From.GetTitledFirstName] has shifted his head's position in his sleep! What does it MEAN!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen24;He wantsss a ritual to be performed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen24;He'sss warning usss of a coming threat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTTITLEslizardmen29;The Ancient Tablet;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen29;[From.GetTitledFirstName] awoke for a minute to make clear the will of the Old Ones: the location of one of the ancient artifacts of the time before the fall of the Polar Gates has been found. Even now the foul agents of strife are working to cloud the vision of the Mage-Priest and snatch away this sacred relic. Its recovery would be invaluable to further the understanding of the Great Plan, you are therefore charged to lead an expedition in this foreign land and clear the way for the Skink archeologists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen29;Mobilize our armiesss immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEslizardmen29001;The Lizardmen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen29001;Foul news from afar: it appears a great alien fleet is sailing towards your realm, charged with coldblooded monsters. \n The mysterious lizard people of the far west have left their resting places for your realm. There is no telling why or when they will arrive, but it is clear their intentions are not peaceful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen29001;We must prepare to meet them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEslizardmen29002;The Ancient Tablet;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen29002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent out messengers in the name of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], to inform all Skink Priests it is the will of the Mage-Priests to focus their efforts on the recovery of an ancient tablet of the Old Ones, divined into a faraway realm of savages. \n\n As a devout follower of the Old Ones, it is your duty to join the efforts of your spawn siblings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen29002;Mobilize our armiesss immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen29002;It might resssult in a missscalculation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen31005;Since the start of the war, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has appeared restless in his sleep. Many Skinks agree this is a clear sign the Slann disapproves of this war and wishes it to be ended immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen31005;Asss the Old Oness command!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen31005;It could be sssomething elssse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen32005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has awaken! He has determined the victory in this war is essential to the ultimate achievement of the Great Plan and has decided to take the lead himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen32005;I bow before you, Great One.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen33005;You've done what you could to forward the Great Plan and the interests of the Old Ones in this world.

You're confident the Skinks will fill in your absence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen33005;Hnnnfffhhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen34001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] did not wake at the first attempt. Trying again so soon would be sacrilegious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCslizardmen43;You Sentinels have found out a group of miyan hunters roaming about near one of your sacred sites. It was only through the grace of the Ancients these ravenous creatures didn't eat one of the sacred artifacts before being apprehended.\n The foul-smelling mammals squeak in some barbarous language, trying to plead for their useless lives, most likely.\n The Sauri are ready to make short work of the plump robbers and await your command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCslizardmen44;A wild Amazon has been captured inside your demesne.

EVTDESCslizardmen44007;You redeemed yourself in your exile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen44007;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44008;Your edict may have brought some good after all: [From.GetFirstName] has returned to you, showered in glory, carring trophies of powerful beasts as gifts, and telling of her grand exploits in exile. She submits to your mercy, asking to receive another chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCslizardmen50;Palace life is not so bad. You can have all the pet consorts you desire and live a peaceful and easy life, without tainting yourself with brute violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAlizardmen50;This is the life...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen51;[From.GetFirstName] has grown lazy and complacent in her easy life, grievously staining your family's reputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen51;Hm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52001;In such a dangerous and violent world, you're lucky to be born a noble Amazon. Beautiful, free and rich, with servants for your every need. What else can a woman ask for?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52001;Hmhmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52002;The jungle is a scary place, filled with poisonous plants, dangerous predators and vicious lizardmen, all too ready to sacrifice any trespasser to their bloodthirsty gods. Is it so strange for a person to extert caution in this world?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52002;No it's not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52003;The elders might teach that males are nothing but cattle to be used to produce more Amazons, but how can you resist the lure of a strong man holding you? To be with another and join is such a unique experience...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52003;They're not so bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52004;There are many perks in the palace life, your favourite is to take the first choice of any game the huntresses have managed to hunt during the day. So many good exotic things to try out, the sweetest wine in the realm, strange new spices...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52004;Oh! What's this one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52005;Going out to hunt is such a chore. After all, what are huntresses made for? A well-bred Amazon like you should not trouble herself with such lowly work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52005;Right so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52006;Nothing scares you. Against every foe, any obstacle, your mind is steady and your heart jumps at the chance of a new adventure. You truly incarnate the ideals of Amazon lifestyle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52006;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52007;You're not an hypocrite like all those others, preaching on how they despise males, but then running into the arms of their consorts. You are one of the few to experience love in its purest form: with another woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52007;And the sweetest kind of all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53001;You might have been excessive with the bloodwine. Last thing you remember before awakening in the mud is giggling naked on the roof of the palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen53001;Hnnn... My head!..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53002;On prospect, you might have wanted to go easy on the roasted Naggaront. After a few gurgling noises from your stomach, you rush to puke on the side of a tree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen53002;Bleah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53003;Some of the herbs you tasted were not at all to your liking, for you soon find yourself asking for water, with your face red and a chorus of laughter accompanying your stumbling to the fountain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen53003;Aaahhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53004;One of the concoctions you drank tonight put you in contact with the spirits. You can feel them around you and speak their words to your sisters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTBslizardmen54001;I don't feel like drinking tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCslizardmen54003;[From.GetFirstName] has accepted your challenge for a drinking contest. A few of the other sisters come around the fire to look as you clash the first jug with hers and take the first long sip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen54003;Now you drink!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen54004;With an absentminded look and a sallow face, [From.GetFirstName] shakes her head, admitting defeat. You laugh in triumph as the sisters rise you up and give pats on your back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen54004;Sshtop spinning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen54005;[From.GetFirstName] holds her jug near her face, falters, and shakes her head. You laugh in triumph as the sisters rise you up and give pats on your back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen54005;Sshtop spinning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen54006;[From.GetFirstName] tosses her jug on the sand, waiting for you to take your drink. Your head feels still pretty clear, you should have this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen54006;[From.GetFirstName] tosses her jug on the sand, waiting for you to take your drink. Thinks are starting to get foggy and, as you reach for your jug, you find yourself snickering for no reason, but you should still be able to take another, shouldn't you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen54006;[From.GetFirstName] tosses her jug on the sand, waiting for you to take your drink. At least, that must be the case, you can't really see very well. You wait the right time between hiccups and prepare to drink again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDslizardmen54006;[From.GetFirstName] is just a blurry image before you, across the campfire, but she's still up, which means it must be your turn. You try a few times to get a hold on the drink, until one of the sisters jams it into your hand, and prepare to have at it again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen54006;Jug!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen54006;E-Ennough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen54007;You try to hold the jug and take another sip, but your body cannot take any further and you collapss on the ground with an empty expression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen54007;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen55001;It started just with a little handful taken here and there from the dishes, but it is now becoming clear  you and [From.GetFirstName] are quickly escalating into an open competition for the better courses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55001;I'll show you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen55001;Here, take it. I think I've had enough for tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen55002;It started just with a little handful taken here and there from the dishes, but the moment you started to be more competitive about it [From.GetFirstName] was quick to cower away, leaving you full domain over the main courses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55002;Ah! That'll teach her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen55003;You drag [From.GetFirstName]'s dish towards your side of the campfire, taking mouthfuls out the course as she looks in anger. It started just with a little handful taken here and there from the dishes, but it has become clear you and [From.GetFirstName] are quickly escalating into an open competition for the better courses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55003;Hmmplfh!..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen55004;[From.GetFirstName] puts a hand before her mouth, trying to shake her hand and dragging herself away from the food in disgust, thus declaring you victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55004;Yeah! Crawl away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen55005;[From.GetFirstName] rolls on the side, holding her swollen belly and letting out a painful groan with her mouth still full of half-chewed food. It appears you've prevailed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55005;What's wrong? Having some trouble standing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen55006;[From.GetFirstName] steals one of your dishes, and starts to eat ravenously. In response, you take one of hers, chewing as fast as you can and looking for more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen55006;[From.GetFirstName] still keeps eating. You look around for the next course to snatch from the cheering sisters nearby and almost puke, but it's still not too bad. You probably can take a few more courses...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen55006;You look down, tapping at your swollen belly as you try to get in another bite. [From.GetFirstName] is still eating, so, unless you want to admit defeat, you must keep going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDslizardmen55006;You gurgle, trying to hold in the last bite and take a look at your opponent, confirming she's still chewing another piece of roasted meat, before going back at your course. Probably you can take it for a little longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55006;I... can go... on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen55006;Hmmmpfh... enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen55007;You roll on the sand, holding your swollen belly, incapable of eating one single bite more. You pray the gods to throw up soon while rolling exhausted on your side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55007;*Blrgh*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen56001;In the frenzy of the ritual celebrations, you've bumped laughing into [From.GetFirstName]. Although you didn't mean anything by it, she seemed to take it as a direct challenge and answered pushing you violently on the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen56001;NOW it's on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen56001;Alright, just... calm down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen56002;[From.GetFirstName] just ran into you. You pushed her back, hoping for a fight, but she's too cowardly or drunk to respond and you soon lose interest in her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen56002;Bah, look where you go next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen56102;[From.GetFirstName] just ran into you. You pushed her back, hoping for a fight, and she seems very eager to enable you. Throwing herself right back at you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen56102;Come here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen56004;The two of you fight off nearby the campfire, trying to get a hold on each other, hitting and breaking off.\n Soon, other sisters gather around, cheering for one or the other, as your fight grows more violent, bolstered by the screams of the other Amazons, inhebriated by the festivities in honor of the Snake-Goddess. \n You throw yourselves at each other, roll in the mud, grapple and punch at every opening.\n Finally, you manage to take a hold of your opponent from the back and squeeze, keeping her tight until she screams defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen56004;YAAHH!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAslizardmen56005;Hhhnnng! Enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53005;The climax of the celebration has passed from a few hours and now you find yourself tired and happy, wrapped around your sisters, near the campfire. As you say sweet things to each other in your drunken stupor, you feel quite happy to be in such a company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen53005;I love you guys!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53006;Under the beating of the drums you fret and dance, alongside your sisters, screaming on the top of your lungs praises for Serena and the other Old Gods, hoping your celebration will bring their favour upon your tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen53006;Hear us, almighty Creators!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53007;As the celebration reaches its climax, inhebriated by the mystic fumes of the shamans and driven into a near-frenzy by your dancing, you run around the campfire, screaming louder to make the gods notice you. \n The Elders finally carry forth the sacred snakes for the rituals to Serena, and the scaley creatures are set free amongst you.\n At first, you jump near them, teasing their bite and retreating just before they strike, then you come slower, with little offerings to endear them to you and lay down, letting them embrace and protect you as Rigg protects Amazonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen53007;Dance with us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTHslizardmen17;Sacrifice some, but keep the best for my harem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen60;Your huntresses have captured an interesting speciment from your last raid. What should be done with him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen60;I'll keep him for my collection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen60;He will be sacrificed soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen61;You've sent your couriers to spread the word as quick as possible: you will organize a great tournament within the great ruins so that you and your sisters may revel in the excitement of violence and the gods may take your sweat and blood as tribute and look down upon you with favour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen61;Rigg be praised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen61001;Fellow Sister!\n I call upon you to shed blood in name of Rigg! Let the Great Huntress be pleased as all of the daughters of Serana fight for her favour in the great ruins!\n\n We await you.\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen61001;About time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen61001;I think I'll pass this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen61002;Rigg be praised!\n I will join you in the great ruins, sister and prove my worth for all of the Amazons to see!\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen61002;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen61003;Sorry, fellow sister,\n but I send this message to inform you I will not be able to take part in your great ritual this season.\n\n May Rigg forgive me.\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen61003;Bah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen62;All the able-bodied Amazons in your realm have gathered in the great ruins for the brawling tournament you've organized in honor of Rigg. Not only nobleblood to participate, but many huntresses, eager to meet the best amongst the daughters of Serena and learn by watching them fight under the eyes of the goddesses.\n All your sisters flock over the old stone steps half-eaten by the jungle, looking down in the arena in anticipation.\n Above them, the fallen statues of the Creators look down with blind eyes. As the legend goes, only when enough blood will be shed in the sand of the arena, the great statue of Rigg will come to life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen62;Not enough Amazons came at your call. The great ruins lie empty before you, with just some curious huntresses roaming around. You've waited for a few days now and it is certain no one else will come.\n It is with great regret that you announce you are forced to cancel the tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen62;And so let the blood start spilling!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen62;This was a waste of time;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAslizardmen62001;Let's start this already!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen62002;As the ruling Queen of your realm, it is only right for you to be the first to fight, to honor Rigg and lead your sisters by example.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen62002;I will be an exemplar winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen62003;It is your turn to fight for the glory of Rigg and yourself. You walk towards the centre of the arena, accompanied by the cheering of your sisters sitting and hanging from the ruins around you. [From.GetFirstName], your adversary, comes from the opposite side to meet you in the middle. You bump into each other's chest and prepare yourself for the starting drum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen62003;Bring it on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAslizardmen62004;Bring it on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen62005;[From.GetFirstName] was sad to announce that, due to lack of participants, the tournament will be cancelled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen62005;All this road for nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen63001;You start circling each other, waiting for the right time to strike. [From.GetFirstName] is the first to lunge forward with her spear, but you manage to dodge her and roll on the side, kicking at her ankle and making her lose balance.\n [From.GetFirstName] jumps back, avoiding your next strike, you cross spears, drawing closer to each other and, at the last moment, you headbutt her, pushing her on her back and planting your blade near her throat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen63001;[From.GetFirstName] is the first to attack, waving her the point of her spear to force you in defence, you dodge and deflect her attacks as fast as you can, ignoring the small cuts and trying to wait for her to lose her thrust.\n Finally, you see an opening and strike, startling [From.GetFirstName] and managing to get close enough to strike her down and force her surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen63001;You try several feigns, but when [From.GetFirstName] finally seems to be falling for it, it turns out to be a feign on her part. You violently cross your spears and, rather than allow the other to take the other's, end up throwing both away.\n Now bare-handed, you keep on fighting in the sand, punching and kicking. Finally, you manage to grab a hold on [From.GetFirstName]'s hair and slam her head on your knee, making her pass out and achieving victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCslizardmen63003;The crowd cheers as you stand over your defeated opponent, raising your ceremonial spear and proclaiming your victory to the goddesses. Yet, there are more fights to be held, and more challenges for you to be overcome if you wish to be named champion of Rigg in this day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen63003;Who's next?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen64;You throw your spear, stained in the blood of many of your sisters, at the feet of Rigg's statue and turn to the Queen to bow down and accept the laurels of the champion. You've won every challenger and rightfully earned the honor that is bestowed unto you.\n Today, you've shown before all the goddesses and huntresses that you are the strongest Amazon of your realm.\n A crowd of your sisters descends from the wrecked stadium to cheer and carry you out, for the final celebration to be consumed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAslizardmen65001;I'll go hunting, I think.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen65002;This tournament has been a great test of your skills. Between the training and the strain of the challenges themselves, you feel stronger than you've ever been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen65002;I could lift a tree!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen65003;Fretting wildly under Rigg's eyes, exchanging violent blows with your sisters, fighting to the end, this whole tournament felt you with a rage and a thirst for battle you've never felt before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen65003;Rigg's touch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen65004;You were just about to leave the stadium with your sisters after the final feast for your victory, when you received a mystical vision: the Huntress, stalking her scaled preys in the shadow skies over the ruined temple. You can feel her touch, Rigg has truly blessed you today!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen65004;And I am worthy of this blessing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTIslizardmen17;The Snake-Goddress Serena!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGslizardmen63001;You're the first to draw blood, slashing a light wound on [From.GetFirstName]'s arm. She waves her spear at you, forcing you to back down and stall for an opening.\n You have your chance to attack, but you trip in the sand. [From.GetFirstName] sees her opportunity and strikes down while you're on the ground.\n You manage to turn belly-up and parry her blow with your spear. She falls on you, aiming your face with her elbow, but you dodge, using her thrust to end over her, with your blade at her chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHslizardmen63001;The duel starts violently, but an hour later the two of your are still fighting, without any sign of tiredness.\n [From.GetFirstName] screams and taunts you, lunging with her spear, aiming for your neck. You bend your knees and violently draw a line in the air above you with your weapon, managing to cut the tip of her spear. Before she can try and react, you've pointed your blade at her chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIslizardmen63001;You attack first, but your strike ends in the sand as [From.GetFirstName] slips on the side and waves her spear lower, aiming for your legs. You jump, throwing your weapon at her, and when she dodges, you fall on her, grabbing her spear. As she tries to shake you off, [From.GetFirstName] starts biting you on the shoulder. Ignoring the pain, you keep your hold, pushing her down with your weight and finally managing to point her blade on her own neck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCLslizardmen63001;A few minutes in, after the duel has started, and you don't even remember where your spears might have ended. [From.GetFirstName] and stand one against the other, holding arms, trying to force your opponent down.\n Won by frustration, you try to ram into her with your last remaining strengths, managing to break the stale, but she ends being the one on top, closing her arm around your neck and starting to squeeze. In a last-ditch effort, you jab her from behind, quickly turning and landing the final punch straight on her face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCslizardmen52008;An Amazon should be strong and inspire her sisters with her figure, what huntress could follow a weak leader? Your body is so frail, what does it matter if the will behind it is strong? It won't protect you if a Naggaront mauls you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52008;The body is not all;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52009;When your sisters call you a strong leader, they're not speaking metaphorically: you are an example of how an Amazon Queen should be, with muscles of steel, chiseled on your arms and chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52009;Just look at this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52010;You've been educated to always appease and accomodate, to always try and talk before fighting. What Amazon could respect such a spineless leader? An Amazon should not care about words, she should meet any opposition with the tip of her spear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52010;Wait, come on, let's talk about this!..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52011;You're a woman of few words, you prefer to let your actions speak for you. And it is well often for your actions to be violent in nature. This is the sort of Queen the Huntresses can respect, the one who fights with them and wastes no time in small talk and appeasement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52011;Rightly so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52012;When was the last time you went out to hunt alongside your sisters? Instead, you waste your days gorging on their game, growing fat and complacent on your throne. What sort of proud Warrior-Queen are you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52012;The body is not all;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52013;You lead Amazons, yet you yourself are by many considered just a freak. You were born wrong, they said, and rightly so. With such a deformed body, how can you be expected to defend your realm and fight with your sisters?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52013;It's not MY fault!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen61900;It's been a long journey, but you're finally back home. A great festival to honor Rigg can only be organized every so often, it'll be at least five solar rotations before another one may be issued.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen61900;I had a good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen70;It is only a question of reading correctly the right table to understand the location of the old Temple of Rejuvenation. It is an important part of the Legacy of the Ancients and must be recovered and preserved. It is undoubtedly part of the Great Plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen70;Since childhood, you heard stories of the fabled philter of eternal life, gifted by the goddesses to their best huntresses. Now you have your chance to finde the ancient pool and bathe into it, as the legend goes, re-emerging strong and young forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen70;This will be a long and perilous voyage, but the prize will be well worth all the trouble.\n You will venture in the unknown jungles of Lustria, one of the most inhospitable places in the world, and return with the fabled philter of eternal youth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen70;Time to go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen71;You were swimming deep through one of the narrow rivers choked by tne intricate flora of the jungle when you catch a series of small shadows moving the waters not too far from where you are. The savages' ambush might have been ruined, but you must fight through them to get to your destination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen71;You were sailing across one of the narrow rivers choked by the intricate flora of the jungle when one of your sisters is struck down by a poisonous dart. You immediately recognize it as a miyan ambush and shout to the other Amazons to shield themselves immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen71;You were sailing across one of the narrow rivers choked by the intricate flora of the Lustrian jungle, when one of your guards falls from the side of your boat, with his back covered with needles. A shrieking pack of bloated miyans emerges from the trees on both sides, starting to shoot more of the poisonous darts on your group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen71;Wait! We don't want trouble!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen71;Attack!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen71001;You hiss the order of attack to the Sauri and await in the depths of the river as the warriors emerge and maul meticulously the unwary mammals before they can react. The water has turned red and thick with blood once the Sauri swim back to you giving the all-clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen71001;Your arrows and spears soon find their place in the numb skulls of the miyans, killing and scaring the little men away without significant losses for your group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen71001;Your men fire at the vile savages for some time, quickly forcing them to retreat behind the trees. You continue to shoot until you've passed the ambush point for a while, making sure the little pests are not following you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen71001;We keep moving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen71001;Perhaps it's time to abandon this quest;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen71002;You hiss the order of attack to the Sauri and await in the depths of the river as the warriors emerge and maul meticulously the unwary mammals from below. Even then, the litte creatures manage to toss some spears and shoot some darts back, killing a Saurus and even managing to reach you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen71002;Your arrows and spears soon find their place in the numb skulls of the miyans, killing and scaring the little men away. Even so, you lose another sister and are wounded yourself before finally winning the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen71002;Your men fire at the vile savages for some time, but suffer several losses before finally managing to force them to retreat. You continue to shoot until you've passed the ambush point and only then realize you've been wounded by the little creeps as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen71002;Grmphf!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen71002;Perhaps it's time to abandon this quest;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen71003;You hiss the order of attack to the Sauri and await in the depths of the river as the warriors swim towards the mammals, but the creatures manage to see the coming attackers and react with uncanny speed. The Sauri are struck through the head by their spears and a storm of poisonous darts falls upon you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen71003;One after the other, your Amazons fall to the poisonous darts of the miyans. Some do not even manage to take any of them before falling, an ignominous death. You are among the last, keeping on fighting until the poison takes away your last strengths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen71003;Your men fire at the vile savages for some time, but suffer several losses and are finally overcome by the miyans. You're riddled with poisonous darts as you try to leave the boat and fall head-first into the water, slowly sinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen71003;Ghhhh!..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen71004;Speaking in their dialect and explaining your quest, you manage to calm down the miyans. They've dealt with Amazons before and, although it was not always a peaceful experience, they agree to let you and your sisters pass through their territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen71004;Hard to believe half-males would be so reasonable;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen71005;You've tried to explain you and your sisters mean no harm to the miyans and only desire to travel on, but their chief appears to have had already unpleasant experiences with other Amazons and screams to resume the attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen71005;Fine! You brought this on yourself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen72;It looks like another coming storm at first, but as the thundering noise grows stronger, you realize it's much worse: the trees in front of you shake violently and are eradicated as a pack of crazed stegadonts rampages through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAslizardmen72;Run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen72001;The thunder-lizards have not even noticed your group, so it's not too hard to slip away, letting them proceed with their rampage without suffering any losses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAslizardmen72001;That was a close one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen72001;Perhaps it's time to abandon this quest;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen72002;The thunder-lizards have not even noticed your group, but moving away from their trajectory fast enough is still no easy trick. A couple of your Sauri end up trampled and you yourself suffer a minor injury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAslizardmen72003;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen73;You were crossing a barren canyon, filled with the poisonous stench of a yellow-snatcher, when you finally catch the feeble scent of other Lizardmen. You emit a high-pitched hiss, and the ambushers come out, weapons still at hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen73;You were crossing a barren canyon, filled with the poisonous stench of a yellow-snatcher, when you finally realize one of your sisters has gone missing. You call the others to alert and catch the shimmering of scales from above you. It's the Lizardmen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen73;You were crossing a barren canyon, filled with the poisonous stench of a strange flower, when you finally realize one of your men has gone missing. You call the others to alert and catch the shimmering of scales from above you. It's the Lizardmen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen73;There'sss no need for violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen73;Attack!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen73001;You've stained yourself with the blood of fellow Lizardmen. It is impossible to say how their loss may impact or slow down the achievement of the Great Plan. This is not a good day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen73001;The Lizardmen have a good vantage point, but you and your sisters have better aiming skills. You keep firing arrows as you run across the canyon, finally reaching a shielded point and carefully proceeding from there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen73001;The Lizardmen have a good vantage point, but you and your men have superior firepower.. You keep shooting the higher slope as you march across the canyon, finally reaching a shielded point and carefully proceeding from there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen73001;We must keep moving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen73001;Perhaps it's time to abandon this quest;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen73002;You've stained yourself with the blood of fellow Lizardmen. It is impossible to say how their loss may impact or slow down the achievement of the Great Plan. This is not a good day. Even worse, in their misguided efforts, the enemy Lizardmen managed to wound you and kill some of the Sauri.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen73002;The Lizardmen have a good vantage point, but you and your sisters have better aiming skills. You keep firing arrows as you run across the canyon, but there's no safe point in sight and you end losing several good sisters before leaving the battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen73002;The Lizardmen have a good vantage point, but you and your men have superior firepower... You keep shooting the higher slope as you march across the canyon,  but there's no safe point in sight and you end losing several good men before leaving the canyon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen73002;We must keep moving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen73002;Perhaps it's time to abandon this quest;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen73003;You've stained yourself with the blood of fellow Lizardmen and still have not managed to fulfill your self-imposed task. Your misguided attackers take full advantage of their superior position and numbers to whither down your forces, until there's no one of you left standing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen73003;You thought your aiming skills would have been enough to counteract the Lizardmen's highter ground, but it was to no avail. The poisonous field slows you and before you know it, a spear falls into your back, pinning you on the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen73003;You hoped to scare the creatures away with your superior firepower, but the Lizardmen are resilient and the poisonous flowers slow your men's reflexes. They fall one after the other and in the end your turn comes as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen73003;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen73004;A Saurus was leading the pack of Lizardmen on the slope of the canyon, while he was quick to action, he was also very receptive when he recognized you as a Skink Chief and carefully listened to your words before hissing to his warriors to stand down and let you pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen73004;There wasss no doubt about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen73005;A Saurus was leading the pack of Lizardmen on the slope of the canyon, they are made to be quick to anger and violence and it turns out to be impossible to catch his attention to speak with him now that he's in a frenzy. You will have to fight them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen73005;Hmmssssshhh;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen75;You've spent years scouring the deadly jungles of Lustria, but still no trace of the fabled Fountain of Youth. Your funds for this expedition have been depleted. Perhaps it is time to renounce to this foolish quest and return to your home, before dying or being driven insane by your obsession?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen75;No! I've enough resources to found another expedition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen75;I have neither money nor strength to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen74;This might finally be it. The old ruins lay before you, buried under layers upon layers of jungle plants, but the glyphs leave no doubt about it: this is the place you're looking for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen74;Check for traps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen74;Let's move!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen74001;Three of your group fall into a pit trap right as they walk on the final staircase. Luckily, you are alright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen74001;Forward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen74002;Three of your group fall into a spiked pit trap right as they walk on the final staircase. One of them almost drags you to the same end, but you manage to hold onto the edge and survive, albeit wounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen74002;Forward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen74003;The portal to the inner temple is so close, but in your rush, you are doomed: a pitfall opens under your feet and you fall screaming alongside your warriors to a spikey death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen74003;AaaaaAAAAHHH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen74004;You were right to check for traps. There are several levers and false steps to be disabled or avoided altogether. You manage to get safely across the final staircase and cross the main portal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen74004;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen76;The dark hallways are covered in ancient glyphs, long-consumed by dampness and mould. And yet, you can still make out some of the prophecies written upon them. This is the place where your quest will end. You know there will be a guardian and when the Coatl floats down, wrapping his coils on the columns between you and the final room and spitting words of warning, you are ready to bow down before him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen76;The dark hallways are covered in ancient glyphs, long-consumed by dampness and mould. They are the tongue of the Ancients, whose understanding has been long-forgotten by the Amazons. Yet you know your close and you feel the traps could not have been your final test.\n It is then that the Coatl floats down from the ceiling, hissing and wrapping his coils along the columns of the main corridor to block your way. He might threatening you in the ancient tongue, but it's hard for you to understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen76;The dark hallways are covered in ancient glyphs, long-consumed by dampness and mould. Not that you could understand them in any case.\n You're focused on the faint light coming from the end of the main corridor, you know that's your final destination, you can almost hear the sound of the water. \n None of your group realizes the danger untile the massive feathered snake floats from above, spitting poison and fire upon you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen76;Guardian of the Old Ones, hear my plea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen76;*Try to speak in the ancient tongue*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen76;We must attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen77;"The Coatl stares deeply into your soul, hissing slowly.\n ""You have been created to accomplish this task. But such is not the task you believed to be fighting for when you left your pool. You will be thus allowed to enter the source of Rejuvenation, so that you may serve the Creators in your ultimate goal, but you shall never mention of this place, nor bring anything with you. Such is the will of the Ancients.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen77;"The Coatl stares deeply into your soul, hissing slowly.\n ""You were not created to accomplish this task, yet you are here. It is not the will of the Ancients for you to drink from this well, nor to share its knowledge with your siblings. You were wrong by coming here, yet the Ancients still have a place for you in your grand design. Return from whence you came, forget about this place and accomplish their true will.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen77;I am humbled and ready to do the will of the godsss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen77;This *mussst* be my task! Ssstand aside!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen77;I recoil at your wordsss, o mighty one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen77001;It took a messenger of the Old Gods themselves to let you understand the error of your ways, but you understand now this quest was never yours to take. You will return home, to your predesigned duties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen77001;Yesss;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen78;It is difficult to pronounce the proper words and even more difficult to understand the answer of the Coatl. There is no doubt he is angered about something and, after a few repetitions, it is clear what is the general meaning of his answer: you are not meant to be in this place, you've angered the gods and, unless you flee immediately, he shall crush and swallow you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen78;(Lie) Let me offer myself as compensation for the offense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen78;Not if I kill you first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen78;I will do as the Ancients command;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen78001;The Coatl is initially surprised by your offering, but his tone turns pleased soon enough. You lay on the ground, tossing aside your spear and ordering to your sisters to stand back, and call for the great snake to take the offering again.\n The Coatl slithers towards you, opening his jaws, and with a slow movement of his neck starts swallowing you.\n You hold your breath and await until you're completely inside the creature, then free your dagger and violently stab the creature's head from the inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen78001;Die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen78002;The Coatl shakes his head at the first stab, but, before you can cut deeper, drowns you in a flow of fire and poison, ending your little deception in a swift swallow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen78002;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen78003;The Coatl shakes his head, trying to spit you out, but you stab deeper, piercing his skull and cutting into his brain again and again. The body of the creature twists and whirls as your sisters start to attack it as well, until it finally crumbles into the ground and you emerge from it, covered in spit and blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen78003;AAAHH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen79;The great snake whirls his coils around the entire corridors, whipping and spitting and lunging with his fangs, killing a warrior with each strike.\n You strike it again and again, cutting through his scales at dozens of points, but the blades and spears can barely draw blood.\n At every burst of fire, your forces dwindle, if you do not kill the guardian soon, you will not survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen79;Kill him! Kill him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen79001;The guardian was too strong for your tired forces. With a final swoop, the Coatl burns the remaining warriors and crushes you under his deadly coils.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen79001;Arrghh;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen79002;Bleeding from a thousand cuts, the great snake finally falls, defeated. You stand over his carcass, cutting away his head and proceed further. None of your warriors survived, but that doesn't matter anymore;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen79002;I'm so close;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen80;There it is, not like you expected, actually. It's not a fountain at all, more like a pool, shimmering with unearthly light, water boiling but exhaling no warmth you can perceive. You slowly and carefully enter, one foot at a time, bending over the surface to take a deep sip.\n The liquid has no flavor, but as it runs through your body, you feel immediately reinvigorated, you feel yourself young and strong as never before.\n The legends were true and you've been one of the very few to find the source of eternal life and partake in it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen80;I shall be young forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11156;Eating regularly and with no heavy thought in the head seems to have finally restored your health. You're no longer mistaken for an undead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1156;Good. Let's not exaggerate now, though;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild2001;You're finally old enough to start your Amazon training and you couldn't be more excited. You've heard a lot of the exploits of the older sisters of your tribe and can't wait to be a proper huntress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild2001;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild2002;You're finally old enough to start your Amazon training, but, although you have good intentions, it seems you just can't manage to keep up with the tasks that are assigned to you. It's as if you're not strong enough to be a proper Amazon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild2002;I must make it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild2003;You've been battered with all this nonsense about female supremacy and Amazonian toughness and bravery from your entire childhood. Now you should start training to become like all the other brainwashed sisters, but the truth is, you've no intention to comply with any of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild2003;I'll find my own path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild3001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] sure looks excited to start [From.GetHerHis] training and become a proper Amazon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild3001;That's the spirit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild3001;Then she can work it out on her own;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild3002;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] should start to train as a proper Amazon, she's old enough to do it, but she really doesn't seem to have what it takes, regardless of her efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild3002;We'll just have to try harder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild3002;She's a lost cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild3003;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] should start to train as a proper Amazon, but she seems to resist every attempt at teaching her the superior values of your culture, ignoring or criticizing anything her elders tell her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild3003;I'll whip her in place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild3003;She's a lost cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4;You're finally out in the wilderness, following the your elder sisters in the hunts. The Jungle is a scary and dangerous place, but you're growing more confident at each expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4;I'm not scared of the dark trees!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4001;You've started sending your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] out with some of the huntresses, so that she may start learning how to stalk the easier game. The little Amazons seems to be going fine, growing confident in her skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4001;*Encourage her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild4001;*Berate her for her recklessness*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild4001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4002;[From.GetFirstName] listened to your more recent experiences in the jungle with great interest and complimented you for your bravery in the face of the dangerous task you were part of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4002;I'll be the best Amazon ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4003;[From.GetFirstName] listened to your more recent experiences in the jungle, but she didn't look very happy about it. She disciplined you for your recklessness, telling you an Amazon, even if without fear, shouldn't brazenly go against any danger without thinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4003;But I thought..?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4004;[From.GetFirstName] barely listened to your more recent experiences in the jungle. It seems your steady heart was not enough to obtain her approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4004;What else can I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4005;Your [GetFromRelation] was very excited of your praise and promised to keep pushing her limits more and more at every next expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4005;Good girl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4006;Your [GetFromRelation] was saddened by your disapproval. She has started to act more cautiously, sometimes even trying to aviod going out with the huntresses, but it's hard to say if it'll stick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4006;It better be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4007;Your [GetFromRelation] seemed to have interpreted your lack of interest as displeasure. She keeps going hunting with her elder sisters, but is growing more and more frustrated in her attempts to impress you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4007;That's good for her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5;Training alongside other girls, competing with each other, going out with the elders to learn how to hunt, everything is making you feel more open and included amongst your sisters. You might not be related by blood, but you share a kindred spirit and only together can you survive in the jungle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5;We're in this together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is growing more talkative and friendly. Spending a lot of time with other girls of her age, talking and training together has opened her and allowed her to find a place in the younger community.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5001;*Encourage her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild5001;*Berate her for not focusing on her training*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild5001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5002;Your [GetFromRelation] seems very pleased of seeing you interact and make friends with the other young Amazons, teaching you about the importance of friendship and cohoperation amongst the daughters of Serena.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5002;I'm glad to be a part of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5003;Your [GetFromRelation] has disciplined you today for wasting so much time with your friends in useless activities, when you should have focused only on your training. You are training to become a strong ruler, the other girls are not your allies, they're in competition with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5003;I.. I won't forget this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5004;Your [GetFromRelation] doesn't really seem to mind of your friends and the time you spend with them. You're not sure if this is a good or a bad sign. The other girls told you not to worry about it, but you're unsure what to make of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5004;Is it.. good? Bad?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5005;Your [GetFromRelation] was emboldened by your acceptance of her new friends and has started spending more and more time out, training, talking, becoming her own woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5005;I'm proud of her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5006;Your [GetFromRelation] was confused at first by your complaints about her behavior, but has now slowly started to avoid her new friends, trying to focus entirely on her training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5006;She better keep at it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5007;Your [GetFromRelation] still spends a lot of time with her friends. With your lack in interest in her situation, she has started to rely on them to get her opinion from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5007;Hm, whatever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6;You really want to become a strong and famous Amazon when you grow up, but this training is just exhausting. Since some time now, you've tried to avoid some of the sessions, just to take some time to rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6;I'm not really lazy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6001;Despite her willingness to train and her staunch trust in the Amazonian ways, [From.GetFirstName] has grown lazy in the last weeks. She might have been excused for a few days, but now it's becoming too much. She's not going to grow into a fit and able woman by sitting on her behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6001;*Enable her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild6001;*Berate her for her lazyness*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild6001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6002;You were relieved to hear from your [GetFromRelation] there's nothing wrong in taking some breaks between training. You'll just lay back for a while, recover your forces, and start your training, good as new.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6002;Just a few more days;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6003;Your [GetFromRelation] was not as understanding as you expected of your time off. She dragged you off your room this morning and had you run across the village from the entire day as a first compensation for your lost time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6003;But I'm so tired!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6004;Your [GetFromRelation] has not complained about your time off of training for now. On the other hand, you are starting to feel a bit guilty about waisting so many days. Perhaps it's time to go back to your previous schedule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6004;Yes, maybe so;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6005;Your [GetFromRelation] was relieved by your understanding of her needs. She now spends even more time skipping sessions and slacking at home, sleeping or eating for most of the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6005;Perhaps I should have been more strict;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6006;You made clear your stance to your [GetFRomRelation]. Hopefully she has learned now to not slack off on her training. Especially if you are her trainer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6006;She'd better have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6007;Your [GetFromRelation] still tends to waste more time at home than she should. Hopefully she'll grow tired of it eventually and get back on schedule for her training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6007;Whenever she feels more comfortable;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6008;You've lost track of most of the friends you made in training, but you've found other at home, to spend days speaking. It was already for the best to stop training. Even though you might have gained a little weight, at least you don't have to drag yourself home exhausted every night...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6008;Hmm;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6009;All this slacking off and skipping training and hunts is not being good for [From.GetFirstName]. She's grown lazy and fat, wasting her days sitting on her growing behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6009;That's pitiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7;Sometime it's friendly fights, sometimes.. not. But you like it, whether you win or lose, in the end it's all for your benefit and the training right? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7;It's just costing a tooth every while;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is growing into quite the spirited girl, picking fights with the other trainees, returning home half of the times with a sore eye or a missing tooth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7001;*Encourage her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild7001;*Berate her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild7001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7002;You were excited to hear of your [GetFromRelation]'s approval of your belligerant attitude. Not that it would matter, after all, if she said anything against it, you would have made her change her mind, one way or the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7002;Damn right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7003;You were very upset when your [GetFromRelation] yelled at you for acting so violently for such allegedly insignificant reasons. You would have striked her, if she didn't look so scary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7003;Maybe next time I will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7004;Your [GetFromRelation] has ignored your black eyes for now. You're fine with it, after all, what's her business what you do when you're out? You just need to get better at it, that way only the other girls will return sore at their home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7004;That's it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7005;[From.GetFirstName] seemed very happy for your endorsement. Last day she started a fight with a girl two years older just to impress you as you were passing by. She didn't win, but still, it was a notable brawl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7005;That's my girl!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7006;[From.GetFirstName] was as furious as you were when you disciplined her about keeping her nerves in check. It was a bad evening, but hopefully she has learned her lession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7006;It better be so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7007;[From.GetFirstName] is keeping to get in some nasty fights. At this point it might be just to catch your attention, as you could swear she's getting more and more violent against her unlucky victims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7007;So what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8;You just can't help it: you do your best, but every time you get into a fight, the other girls end up beating you. Some of the other young Amazons have started purposefully picking up on you, to the point you've become afraid of even leaving your home to go training anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8;I don't wanna!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8001;Some girls have started picking up on your [GetFromRelation], beating and mocking her for her weakly demeanor. They have no fault, of course, but [From.GetFirstName] rather than toughen up and answer in kind, seems to be growing more and more craven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8001;*Enable her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild8001;*Berate her for her cowardice*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild8001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8002;[From.GetFirstName] was very understanding with you, giving a hard talk to the other mean girls and allowing you to spend some days home from time to time. It's a little embarassing to be protected by a grown up, but at least you're not getting beaten anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8002;Yes, at least that;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8003;Your [GetFromRelation] proved to be no more understanding than those bullies: she striked and disciplined you, telling you the problem is not with them but with you and that you must be strong if you want to ever become a true Amazon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8003;But..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8004;Your [GetFromRelation] doesn't really seem to care about your problems. She barely listened when you told her about the bullies and dismissed the whole thing as something for you to solve on your own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8004;But..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8005;Reassuring and helping [From.GetFirstName] with those bullies certainly calmed her down, although you wonder if this will help her in the long run becoming a good Amazon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8005;At least she feels safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8006;The bullies are still picking up on [From.GetFirstName], but at least now she answers in kind from time to time. Hopefully she'll manage to get over it, eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8006;She better be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8007;You don't know what is happening with [From.GetFirstName] and those bullies, nor you care. Probably things are still bad, giving a look on how she comes back home in the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8007;Well, that's on her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9;There are so many things that you can do wrong and having all the eyes of the other better trainees pointed on you make you just feel uncomfortable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9;Can't I train alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9001;Your [GetFromRelation] is going through a streak of shyness it appears. She feels insecure and fears the judgement of her peers, thus trying to avoid any social meating with the girls of her age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9001;*Enable her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild9001;*Berate her for her cowardice*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild9001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9002;You're glad your [GetFromRelation] is allowing you your space in this delicate time. There's nothing wrong with you after all, you just like to be alone for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9002;There's nothing wrong at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9003;Your [GetFromRelation] acted really mean in these days, trying to force you to train with the other girls, embarassing you and putting you on the spot. You don't know how could you possibly ever fight alongside this strangers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9003;I just want to be left alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9004;Your [GetFromRelation] is ignoring you, you couldn't ask for anything better. If she doesn't call you up on your shyness, then why should anyone else? Or why should you care about it if they do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9004;Good, good;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9005;Enabling [From.GetFirstName] might not have been a good idea. While she seems more calm now that she's not pressured into social activities, she might be losing on some fundamental lessons on the Amazonian way of life. If she's ever to become a leader, she can't keep hiding behind you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9005;We'll see;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9006;Forcing [From.GetFirstName] into the social life of a girl her age might be troubling for her now, but you're confident she will learn a valuable lesson and become accustomed to work and fight alongside other Amazons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9006;Exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9007;[From.GetFirstName] still keeps for herself, trying to avoid other girls of her age, always remaining in silent unless explicitly asked something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9007;That's on her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10;You knew it would happen. You tried really hard, but you knew deep down that you were not worthy: today you fought with some other sisters during your training and ended up being seriously injured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10;And we weren't even using real weapons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10001;This is terrible. [From.GetFirstName] somehow managed to get hurt in a training today without even using real weapons. Now she's in her room, moaping, with her arm wrapped in leaves and cloth, incapacitated for at least a week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10001;*Let her recover*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild10001;*Force her to train anyway*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild10001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10002;You were relieved to know your [GetFromRelation] would allow you a full recovery before sending you back to training. At least she was understanding of your pain. Perhaps next time you'll do better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10002;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10003;Nobody could have denied the gravity of your injury, yet [From.GetFirstName] was ready to kick you back into the fields before even a week. The arm still hurts really badly, but you must ignore the pain and keep exercising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10003;Hnn.. It hurts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10004;Your [GetFromRelation] did not even visit you once. On one hand, at least you're being left to heal in peace, on the other your own [GetFromRelation] knows you're suffering and still doesn't feel like visiting you at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10004;Does she hates me so much?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10005;[From.GetFirstName] was relieved of hearing you would have let her heal without fretting her. Now she's fully recovered and ready to return to her training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10006;[From.GetFirstName] still hurts and sometimes returns home bleeding from her wound, but what are you supposed to do? A true Amazon must learn to ignore the pain and fight her way through, that's what's what.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10006;No doubt about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10007;You'd think letting her rot in that bed without bothering her would have at least made her happy, but [From.GetFirstName] seems still sad for some reason beyond the wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10007;That's her problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11;You try your best, but everything turns out wrong for you. You just can't manage to make it as an Amazon. It's all wrong, everybody is against you. You just want to dig a hole and die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11;I want to dieee!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11001;[From.GetFirstName] has grown so frustrated by her recent failures during the training she's started spending her nights brooding and crying in a corner of her room. While she's right to be ashamed of herself, this is hardly the way she'll solve her problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11001;*Enable her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild11001;*Berate her for her weakness*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild11001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11002;You don't want to go out, you don't want to train. Your [GetFromRelation] might have tried to be nice with you, but it only made you feel even more ashamed. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11002;There is no point in going on;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11003;Life is so unfair. Your [GetFromRelation] wouldn't even grant you to sleep to death and dragged you out, forcing you into the training sessions once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11003;Noo! Let me die!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11004;[From.GetFirstName] ignores your pain, but why shouldn't she? You are pathetic after all. A useless reject of an Amazon who will never accomplish anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11004;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11005;You tried to be kind with [From.GetFirstName], but it might have ended up in the opposite of the desired effect: she still wastes herself away in solitude and self-loathing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11005;That's a lost cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11006;[From.GetFirstName] maybe crying and moping, but at least she has a reason to now. You will keep on pushing her out physically for as long as needed until she gets her act up together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11006;Only way to be sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11007;Your [GetFromRelation] is still crying in some corner, probably. She really is a lost cause. She has the chance to learn from a great teacher and be an Amazon, what more does she need?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11007;It's hopeless;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11008;You've stopped going out altogether, you barely eat, you avoid the light and spend your nights crying at the moons. There is no point in going on. You never really had a chance at becoming an Amazon. That's the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11008;It is;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11009;[From.GetFirstName] is still brooding. She hasn't done any progress and all this laying motionless for days and skipping meals made her weak and sickly. This pale skeletrical creature has nothing of an Amazon's pride or look.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11009;Nothing at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12;These ideas of having a society revolve entirely on war and violence is sick and wrong. You've taken your stand today on the field and refused to touch any of the training weapons. Sure, the teacher beat you and the other girls made fun of you, but you know you're standing for what's right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12;And I won't stand down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12001;That [From.GetFirstName] Today she refused to fight during the training session, standing up to the elders and ignoring her sisters' mocking her. The spoiled brat thinks dedicating her life to the art of war and hunt is a waste of time and, for some reason, 'wrong'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12001;Well, she makes some good points;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild12001;What!?! Violence is a sacred principle of our society!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild12001;Psh, that won't make her last long, for sure;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12002;You were suprised when your [GetFromRelation] supported your stance. Perhpas not all grownups are dumb, violent she-beasts as you thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12002;Maybe I can find others who agree with me! Change the system!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12003;It didn't really come as a surprise when your [GetFromRelation] started shouting and pulling you around for your behavior in the field. She's like all the others, blinded by bigotry and anger. It just frustrates you to no end to have to share your life with such troglodites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12003;I'd rather die than be you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12004;You expected more of a fuss from your [GetFromRelation] after your behavior in the fields. It seems she has decided to just ignore you. Like you'd care what she thinks, if she ever thinks at all in that numb skull of hers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12004;I'll just find someone who WILL listen to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12005;[From.GetFirstName] is really set in her ideas it seems. Now that you conceded her some points, she won't stop talking about how the whole way of living of Amazonia is skewed and wrong. She even found other girls in the tribe who share her ideas and started spredding this impure thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12005;That's.. hm, that's not very good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12006;It's like talking to a wall. Your [GetFromRelation] won't just understand the basic principle that being unable to defend yourself in Lustria means dying young. She thinks it'd be better for her to die with her ideas than learn out to throw a spear. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12006;That's just stupid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12007;[From.GetFirstName] is still spewing her nonsense about peaceful coexistance and non-violence. You won't dignify any of that rubbish, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12007;Let her have at it, she'll come around;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13;It just hit you: what's the point of training at all? All Amazons train for is fighting, to breed more senseless violence, cultivating an absurd standard of living and body. Why should you sweat and suffer for it when you think it's wrong? You should break tradition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13;No more training!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13001;Having to put up with her seditious ideas was already enough, but now [From.GetFirstName] has decided to just stop training entirely! She thinks it cultivates a sick and unobtainable standard, whatever that means.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13001;Maybe she has a point;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild13001;One way or the other, she WILL sweat before night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild13001;Whatever she says, I guess;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13002;Your [GetFromRelation]'s support was unexpected, but no less pleasing. You must break the shackles of tradition, go completely against the ideal of Amazonian fitness. Which incidentally is something you really enjoy doing. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13002;It's all for the good of our culture!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13003;Your [GetFromRelation] had to fight and drag you on her back, kicking and screaming, to the fields to have you train again. She striked and yelled at you and did so much that, by the end of the day, you were more tired than you would have been if you trained. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13003;And she's saying she'll do this every day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13004;Your [GetFromRelation] didn't say anything after your decision to stop training altogether. You know she's playing some trick with you, as if you could fall for it. You will keep doing what you feel it's right, to free Amazons from their primitive traditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13004;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13005;[From.GetFirstName] spends her day at home, pontificating about the wrongness of Amazonian ideals while stuffing her face with the meat provided by restless huntresses and countless of hours of stalking. Perhaps it wasn't such a good idea to enable her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13005;She seemed so certain of it;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13006;That's the only way to treat a spoiled child: violence. Sooner or later [From.GetFirstName] will understand that that should be her first, second and last answer to everything. For now, you're satisfied with having had her kick and scream and pull for the whole day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13006;Not training per se, but tiring enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13007;[From.GetFirstName] can make all the excuses she wants for her lazyness, she's not going to sway you. If wasting her life accomplishing nothing is what she desire, then so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13007;It's her life after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13008;You clean off some sauce from your bulging belly and go back at eating. It's amazing how quickly you managed to revert whatever effect the first training might have had on you. As you keep getting fatter each day, you show the true wrongness of Amazonian ideals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13008;I'm sure of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13009;[From.GetFirstName] has really let herself go, following all those frivolous ideas about standards and abstract concepts. If she'd really been smart, she'd have trained along the other girls and become a strong and fit Amazon, rather than a bloated frog.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13009;It's a lost cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14;Not only Amazons spend all that time fighting and hunting, they force those poor males into prisons for no reason at all, using them like cattle and killing them without a tought nor mercy. These are creatures with feelings and emotions! You can connect with them, speak with them.. love them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14;I do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14001;Nothing but blapshemy from [From.GetFirstName], as usual. Tonight she was found making out with one of the males in the stock. When you brought her own she had the gall to say she loved him and that she would free all of them one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14001;It's a bad business, but.. It's the way things are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild14001;You don't know what you say, stupid girl!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild14001;Whatever, see if I care;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14002;While [From.GetFirstName] wasn't entirely against you, it was clear you won't find support and help for the oppressed men from her. She is, after all, like the others. You'll just need to be more discreet in future with your nightly escapades in the male stock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14002;Something the train is good for, finally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14003;You knew [From.GetFirstName] would have forbidden to go to the stock again, but you couldn't imagine she could have had your love slaughtered by her huntresses! Now how could you go there again? Even if you found another one, she'd kill him to. Are you destined to live a loveless live?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14003;It can't be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14004;Your [GetFromRelation] must have been fed up entirely with you if she didn't even react after being told you were found kissing a male in the livestock. This can only mean you're making a difference: others would have screamed, acted violently or hypocritically, but she was just speechless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14004;I'm making a difference!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14005;You thought you had convinced [From.GetFirstName], but rumors still run she is keeping her unnatural sympathies for the males, as if she could change their position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14005;It's just a child's dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14006;You had to have the male killed, such activities would have brought ruin upon you as well otherwise. Rigg does not tolerate males in her home. [From.GetFirstName] will get over it, eventually, and understand why was it right to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14006;And she'd better do it fast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14007;Probably your [GetFromRelation] is still going out at night, meeting her male friends. She will grow bored with their gruff charms and caresses soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14007;Never too soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild15;Why should you be trapped in this backwater savage society? You aspire for much more than hunting and fighting. There is a better world out there, you only need the courage to leave this broken life behind and start anew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild15;And so I will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild15001;This is unheard of! It was bad already to have that attitude, but now [From.GetFirstName] has disappeared! She escaped, leaving a message telling you she will never become an Amazon and has fled to a better world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild15001;It's her life after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild15001;This will NOT stand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild15002;You were too quick and too smart for your jailers. You've left your home and the ruins with nobody catching you. You finally have a chance to do what you always wanted! Your whole life is ahead of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild15002;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild15003;You barely reached the boundaries of your tribe's territory when two hunters jumped on you, dragging you back to your [GetFromRelation] in the darkness of night. She disciplined you once more, making it clear escaping will never be an option for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild15003;I HATE YOU!!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild15005;[From.GetFirstName] is too far now. She wanted so much to be free, let's hope at least she makes something good of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild15005;Hm, I doubt that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild15006;She may be screaming and swearing eternal hate upon you, but [From.GetFirstName] is back. It wasn't hard to track her down. It's only a matter of time until she realize what her destiny really is and accepts it with gratitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild15006;As it is for all of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild16;You've prepared your whole life for this day. It has come the time to test yourself, go alone in the jungle, prove your worth and be accepted by your tribe as a full-fledged Amazon. You feel confident in your abilities, you've been trained exactly for this, but you cannot hide a hint of fear alongside the anticipation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsamazonchild16;You tried the best you could, despite all your limitations, and the time has come for the final test, to go alone in a hunt and return with a prize worthy of yourself. Then, if you've survived, you'll be an Amazon. You're scared and stressed and dearly hope to not be a shame for your family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsamazonchild16;You couldn't believe they would try you anyway, after all you've said and done you thought you'd made pretty clear those traditions mean nothing to you. Yet, once again, you're forced against your will to go on a hunt, alone this time, and return with a prize worthy of you, so that you may be an Amazon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDsamazonchild16;At this age an Amazon should go alone in the jungle and prove her worth, but you can't. You've missed your mark and will never become a fully fledged Amazonian huntress like all the other sisters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild16;Time to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild16;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild16001;By not being able to even partake in the final trial, your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has brought shame on your family. As her mother, you are also sharing in this failure more than anybody else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild16001;I have failed her and Amazonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild16003;You tried your best, but the goddesses must have not been with you today. As the night comes, you return empty-handed to your village. You've shamed your family and denied yourself the chance to be a real Amazon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild16003;I'm a disgrace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild16004;[From.GetFirstName] has failed in her rite of passage to become a true Amazon. As her mother, you share this shame forever, for her failings as a huntress are your failings as a teacher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild16004;I am disgraced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17;You've passed the final trial! You return head-high to the village carrying your gruesome trophy and are welcomed by the cheers of your sisters. It is now time for you to follow the elders deep into the ruins of the great temple and perform the final rite which will turn you into a real Amazon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17;I'm ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17001;You enter the dark coven, the old Priestesses of Serena chanting on each side of the damp hall, and you shyly find your way to the sunken altar and kneel to give your respects to the Snake-Goddess and receive her blessing.\n It starts like nothing, you start feeling your clothes getting tighter as your frame grows wider and tougher. You get back on your feet, with a light head. All your worries are gone, it's all very simple: you're an Amazon, strong and deadly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17001;Awesome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17002;You enter the dark coven, the old Priestesses of Serena chanting on each side of the damp hall, and you shyly find your way to the sunken altar and kneel to give your respects to the Snake-Goddess and receive her blessing.\n It's just a tickle on your skin and only seeing your reflection in the water makes you realize how pretty you've become. You get back on your feet, with a light head. All your worries are gone, it's all very simple: you're an Amazon, beautiful and deadly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17002;Awesome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17003;You enter the dark coven, the old Priestesses of Serena chanting on each side of the damp hall, and you shyly find your way to the sunken altar and kneel to give your respects to the Snake-Goddess and receive her blessing.\n Something must be wrong, for the elders stop chanting, you realize it when you emerge from the pool smaller than you entered it. But you know soon enough this is no mistake: your body might have suffered, but you can see everything more clearly now, your dedication to Amazonia stronger than ever before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17003;Marvelous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17004;You enter the dark coven, the old Priestesses of Serena chanting on each side of the damp hall, and you shyly find your way to the sunken altar and kneel to give your respects to the Snake-Goddess and receive her blessing.\n Something must be wrong, for the elders stop chanting, you realize it when you emerge unchanged from the pool. But this is no mistake: you can feel unearthly energy flow through you and one of the shamans startles as she realizes and tells you the Goddess gave you her greatest gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17004;Eternal youth..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17005;Your daughter [From.GetFirstName] passed her final trial and performed the rite to become a real Amazon. Your heart misses a beat when you see her emerge from the temple, strong and imposing like never before, a true testament to Amazonian superiority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17005;I'm proud of her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17006;Your daughter [From.GetFirstName] passed her final trial and performed the rite to become a real Amazon. Your heart misses a beat when you see her emerge from the temple, beautiful beyond compare, a true testament to Amazonian superiority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAsamazonchild17007;Your daughter [From.GetFirstName] passed her final trial and performed the rite to become a real Amazon. Your heart misses a beat when you see her emerge from the temple with the small body of a child, but the elders soon calm the crowd and yourself down, explaining how the goddess decided to give her a special more subtle gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17007;I guess it's alright.. but still...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17008;Your daughter [From.GetFirstName] passed her final trial and performed the rite to become a real Amazon. Your heart misses a beat when you see her emerge from the temple accompanied by the cheering of the elders themselves, chanting her as blessed by the Snake-Goddess with eternal youth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAsamazonchild17009;I'm a shaman?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17010;Your daughter [From.GetFirstName] passed her final trial and performed the rite to become a real Amazon. Your heart misses a beat when you see her emerge from the temple surrounded by unearthly energies, as the elders announce the Goddess gave her magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17010;My little shaman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild18;Amazonian society only barely tolerates men for their need as breeding stock, but still, a girl of your age starts to have needs. You've started to think perhaps you are searching in the wrong way. Maybe one of your training mates could fill the longing you feel...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild18;I'll ask her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild18001;No, that's not what I want!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild18001;Amazonian society only barely tolerates men for their need as breeding stock, but still, a girl of your age starts to have needs. You've started to think perhaps you are searching in the wrong way. Your friend [From.GetFirstName] must think the same and has attempted some clumsy advances to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild18001;Yes, this sounds like fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild18001;You're really not my type, sorry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild18002;You were so relieved to know [From.GetFirstName] shares your feeling for her. Now you can help each other and explore this new realm of possibilities without fearing the scorn of the goddesses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild18002;It'll be fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild18003;You were saddened to hear [From.GetFirstName] reject your advances. Perhaps this is not the way either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild18003;But.. what then?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild18004;It appears your daughter [From.GetFirstName] has found her happiness with another girl, [FromFrom.GetFirstName]. She has proved once more, a true Amazon doesn't really need men for anything but breeding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild18004;I'm proud of her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen57001;You are dancing alongside your sisters under the pale moons. Your head is a little light from all you've drank and in a pirouette you inadvertitely fall giggling on [From.GetFirstName] she laughs as well, falling with you and likely just as drunk.\n The sand is cold, but you feel her body warm on yours and quickly search for her lips.\n When you're tired and your head starts clearing a bit, you find yourself hugging each other near the camp fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen57001;Oh, I love you, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAslizardmen57003;I love you too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen57004;You spend some more time cuddling [From.GetFirstName] before you laugh it off and get back to the other. It was certainly a crazy night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen57004;We should do this again sometimes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCQslizardmen63001;You strike [From.GetFirstName] at the ankle with the side of your spear, forcing her on her knees, but she quickly thrusts her weapon at you in retaliation. You step back, avoiding her spear, and she takes advantage of it to throw herself at your legs.\n You roll together in the sand, wrestling for control over your spear, until you finally manage to stop on top of her, squeezing her neck between your legs and pointing the spear at her face with a triumphant yell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCRslizardmen63001;[From.GetFirstName] exchanges a few blows with you before pointing her spear on the ground to use it as lever and kick you in the face. \n Temporarely dazed by her attack, you try to step back, but she keeps close, drawing first blood from your arm in an attempt to loosen your grip on your weapon. You hold the spear and attempt a counterattack with one hand, but you can't put enough strength in the weapon to parry hers. In the end, driven by frustration, you just throw the spear, managing to get it through her leg and achieving victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCSslizardmen63001;The fight doesn't start in the best way: [From.GetFirstName] manages to push you down with her shoulder, sliding her spear on the back of your neck, pressing your face against the sand.\n You feel your mind sleeping away as you wiggle, trying to breathe, but finally manage to break her hold with a violent kick on her knee. You crouch and snatch away her spear, battering your head on her chest and holding her down until she surrenders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCTslizardmen63001;The fight starts well, you push [From.GetFirstName] down, take her hair from behind and start banging her head on the sand.\n [From.GetFirstName] struggles, but you keep your hold until she seems to be finally losing her strength. It is at that point that she rolls on the side, grabbing your spear and pushing it back to your jaw.\n You shake away the pain and wave the spear to free it from her hold, finally managing to pin her back down and squeeze her until she passes out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With both weapons pointed at you, you are forced to admit defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen82001;It is a very good day for a hunt and all the needs of command tend to take your [GetFromRelation] away from the true meaning of Amazonian lifestyle. Maybe you should ask her to go on a hunt with you, make sure her senses are still keen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen82001;Certainly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen82001;Maybe another time;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen82002;[From.GetFirstName] has come to you asking if you'd like to go out with her for a hunt. The day is bright and a exotic creatures await for your blades and arrows. What do you say?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen82002;Yes, please! I can't stand it here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen82002;I'm kind of busy right now;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen83;It gets discomforting, at times, how the burden of command prevents you from enjoying life like any other huntress, running in the wilds, stalking monsters. When those thoughts start festering your mind, you can only find solace in a good barrel of ripplejuice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen83;The burden of command might not allow you to enjoy life like any huntress, running in the wilds, but that doesn't mean you have to wither away on your throne. You have still many friends at court and many fun ways to spend your nights without going through the trouble of hunting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen83;And anoth-*hic*er for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen84;The pleasure of hunting down your own food is better than any delicacy. Yet, forced to spend all this time in your palace, you have had to give it up to the other huntresses. Is it so hard to think you'd experience that taste once more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen84;You let out an annoyed sigh, pinching a roll of fat at your hip. Amazons are meant to run free, hunt and fight, it's not your fault you've been burdened by the duty of command. Your body is just not accustomed to staying still for so long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen84;It's not really my fault;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen85;You stumble on the carpet, letting out a whimper when you scratch your elbow on the ground. You used to be stronger, you used to be tougher, but being forced to spend so much time at palace, making and upholding rules and resolving disputes It tires you without strengthening you, while your body slowly withers away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen85;You take a look at your arm, skinny and pale. It's hard to imagine how it was when you still had muscles in it. But how can an Amazon flourish, captive in her own palace? You feel so ashamed at yourself, how can you be the strong ruler your sisters look up to when you can barely lift a spear?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen85;I feel so frail;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen86;You don't need to search excitement outside in the jungle! You can have all you want, you're a Queen of Amazonia! Fruit, meat, males, girls, all you can think of can be given with a snap of your fingers. Why should you care about the bad rumors about you? They come from envious people, and should be disregarded as such.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen86;You don't need to search excitement outside in the jungle! You can have all you want, you're a Queen of Amazonia! Fruit, meat, males, girls, all you can think of can be given with a snap of your fingers. And you can share it too, so that all the huntresses can enjoy pleasures beyond their wildest dreams, just like you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen86;Let's party!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen87;You had a lot of fun with [FromFrom.GetFirstName], even though she was clearly out of your league. When you returned back at palace, all covered in mud, sweat and blood, all loaded with meat and trophies, you were exhausted, but you felt alive more than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen87;We should do this more often!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen87001;You had a lot of fun hunting with [From.GetFirstName], although you barely managed to land a few blows on the critters of the jungle. She really is worthy of respect, a ruler like her, still so skilled with the bow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen87001;We should do this more often!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen89;This hunt is turning into a disaster. You barely made it out alive until now, you got separated from [FromFrom.GetFirstName] and are lost at night in the jungle. You don't know yet if you'll manage to reach home in time, if you do, you might want to think through before accepting to go on another wild hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen89;Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen89001;This hunt is turning into a disaster. You barely made it out alive until now, you got separated from [From.GetFirstName] and are lost at night in the jungle. You don't know yet if you'll manage to reach home in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen89001;Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen88;The hunt is proceding fairly well. Both you and [From.GetFirstName] are having fun and have captured a couple of small preys. As you go on though, it becomes clear you're evenly matched and that is enough to spark the spirit of competition within the both of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen88;We'll see who catches the bigger game!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen88001;The Culchan shrieks when you jump from the tree and land on his back. [From.GetFirstName] is ready to point her spear at him, rising from her cover, but the giant bird ignores and tramples her, running away and trying to shake you off.\n You hold onto your spear, sunking it deeper in the back of the Culchan. You're finally thrown off the prey, but you roll easily back on your feet, catching [From.GetFirstName]'s spear and throwing it right on the creature's flank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen88001;A Naggaront you could handle, but, when you entered the cave, you didn't expect to find a nest. At that point it was too late to call off the attack, the two creatures had already caught your stench.\n You throw an arrow at the first, managing to land a lucky shot in its eyes and running for the exit, where [From.GetFirstName] waits for you.\n You put down your spears right before the monsters come out, managing to have them impale themselves with their own charge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen88001;You and [From.GetFirstName] run around in circles, yelling at the top of your lungs, but never leaving the safety of the trees as the pack of crazed Stegandons growls and trumpets, trying to find a way out of the fire you started.\n When the stampede finally gets underway, you start trowing arrows at them, until you've singled out the weaker reptile. Slowed the creature down, you jump on its back together, thrusting your spears many times over in the fissue at the back of its neck, under its bone collar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDslizardmen88001;You keep holding your breath, eyes pointed up as the Terradon slowly approaches the surface of the river to drink. At the last possible moment, you swim out, charging your spear through the creature's chest. The Terradon shrieks, flapping his wings in an attempt to flee.\n You wrap your arms around his neck while [From.GetFirstName] jumps on his back and stabs him again.\n For a few seconds you are left hanging over the trees, but the Terradon cannot sustain the both of you while wounded and finally crashes down, dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEslizardmen88001;You jump behind a rock just in time to avoid the jet of fire spitted by the angry salamander. Quickly putting out a spark in your hair, you look for [From.GetFirstName], readying your bow. The other huntress is crouched on a tree, already aiming. The moment she fires the salamander stops and you leave cover, shooting a second arrow straight into its mouth.\n The monster jerks and coughs, before trying to get out another firey breath, but at that point you have already managed to get close enough to bury your spear under his neck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFslizardmen88001;Hunting down the little lizard led you to an unknown abandoned ruin. You decided to explore it, but a few steps inside and you are already fending off spikey walls, fall pits and poisonous darts.\n You get separated from [From.GetFirstName] and decided to proceed on your own. You carefully avoid a series of false steps and reach the final chamber. The snake idol exposed there is just too pretty to be left alone, but when you take it, a giant boulder falls from above. It is right when you're fleeing for your life that you stumble on [From.GetFirstName] and barely manage to cross the temple's door before getting squashed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGslizardmen88001;The Miyans were not amused when you stole all of their game, but what were you supposed to do? You didn't have any luck in finding decent preys. The little men yell and shoot darts at you as you run with [From.GetFirstName], charged with meat and pelts. You slide to a river and follow its course with the little pests on your heels, then jump off when you reach a waterfall, barely managing to swim back to surface after you land in the torrent with all that extra weight. You quickly run into the wild, before the Miyans may find a safer way down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHslizardmen88001;You hold your breath, pressing behind the tree, looking into every corner, trying to spot the creature. [From.GetFirstName] lays a few feets away, unconscious from a poisoned dart. You barely managed to avoid a similar fate, but now you have to bring her back home immediately. The hunter hisses from the shadows, invisible. You fire a warning shot in what you think it's his general direction, but no avail. Finally, you catch a movement in the leaves and shoot again, this time wounding him. The creature shrieks and you, taking advantage of the distraction, take [From.GetFirstName] and try and run for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIslizardmen88001;The Kroxigor roars, ignoring the wounds on his side and under his eyes. He lowers his head and charges [From.GetFirstName]. The huntress manages to avoid the worst of it, but she's still knocked off. You throw your spear at the creature's back while it's charging your mate, but the Kroxigor just takes the spear out with a grunt and throws it away.\n You plant another arrow near his eye, enraging him further and wait to the last second before jumping away from its charge. The Kroxigor ends sticking his horns on the side of a tree. Before he manages to tear it off, you're back with your spear, plunging it again and again in his back until he finally collapses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCLslizardmen88001;You yell and charge against the Spinodon, falling on your knees at the last second and plunging your spear under his chest, where his scales are thinner. [From.GetFirstName] joins you, attacking him from the side and trying to roll it over, but the creature manages to whip its tails at her, pushing her away. You keep a firm hold on your spear, keeping the Spinodon's jaws away as more and more of his blood spills over you, soaking your skin and enticing your senses. Finally, the monster stops, hanging his head on your weapon, dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCMslizardmen88001;The Carnosaur's jaws snap a few inches from [From.GetFirstName]'s back, taking away a few of her hair in the process. You're a little further, running from the beast.\n You've tried your best, but this doesn't seem like a creature to take down with just two huntresses.\n The reptile roars, carelessly uprooting trees as it pursues you in its frenzy. [From.GetFirstName] almost get trampled at a certain point, but you manage to push her on the side in time. The Carnosaur only stops when you jump off a cliff, roughly landing on some trees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCNslizardmen88001;The Culchan shrieks when you jump from the tree and land on his back. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] is ready to point her spear at him, rising from her cover, but the giant bird ignores and tramples her, running away and trying to shake you off.\n You hold onto your spear, sunking it deeper in the back of the Culchan. You're finally thrown off the prey, but you roll easily back on your feet, catching [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s spear and throwing it right on the creature's flank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCOslizardmen88001;A Naggaront you could handle, but, when you entered the cave, you didn't expect to find a nest.

The moment she fires the salamander stops and you leave cover, shooting a second arrow straight into its mouth.\n The monster jerks and coughs, before trying to get out another firey breath, but at that point you have already managed to get close enough to bury your spear under his neck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCSslizardmen88001;Hunting down the little lizard led you to an unknown abandoned ruin. You decided to explore it, but a few steps inside and you are already fending off spiked walls, pits traps and poisonous darts.\n You get separated from [FromFrom.GetFirstName] and decide to proceed on your own. You carefully avoid a series of false steps and reach the final chamber. The snake idol placed there is just too pretty to be left alone, but when you take it, a giant carved boulder falls from above. It is right when you're fleeing for your life that you stumble on [From.GetFirstName] and barely manage to cross the temple's entrance before getting squashed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCTslizardmen88001;The Miyans were not amused when you stole all of their game, but what were you supposed to do? You didn't have any luck in finding better prey. The little men yell and shoot darts at you as you run with [FromFrom.GetFirstName], loaded with meat and pelts. You slide to a river and follow its course with the little pests on your heels, then jump off when you reach a waterfall, barely managing to swim back to surface after you land in the torrent with all that extra weight. You quickly run into the wild, before the Miyans may find a safer way down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCUslizardmen88001;You hold your breath, pressing behind the tree, looking into every corner, trying to spot the creature. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] lays a few feets away, unconscious from a poisoned dart. You barely managed to avoid a similar fate, but now you have to bring her back home immediately. The hunter hisses from the shadows, invisible. You fire a warning shot in what you think it's his general direction, but no avail. Finally, you catch a movement in the leaves and shoot again, this time wounding him. The creature shrieks and you, taking advantage of the distraction, take [FromFrom.GetFirstName] and try and run for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVslizardmen88001;The Kroxigor roars, ignoring the wounds on his side and under his eyes. He lowers his head and charges [FromFrom.GetFirstName]. The huntress manages to avoid the worst of it, but she's still knocked off. You throw your spear at the creature's back while it's charging your mate, but the Kroxigor just takes the spear out with a grunt and throws it away.\n You plant another arrow near his eye, enraging him further and wait to the last second before jumping away from its charge. The Kroxigor ends sticking his horns on the side of a tree. Before he manages to tear it off, you're back with your spear, plunging it again and again in his back until he finally collapses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCWslizardmen88001;You yell and charge against the Spinodon, falling on your knees at the last second and plunging your spear under his chest, where his scales are thinner. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] joins you, attacking him from the side and trying to roll it over, but the creature manages to whip its tails at her, pushing her away. You keep a firm hold on your spear, keeping the Spinodon's jaws away as more and more of his blood spills over you, soaking your skin and enticing your senses. Finally, the monster stops, hanging his head on your weapon, dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCXslizardmen88001;The Carnosaur's jaws snap a few inches from [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s back, taking away some of her hair in the process. You're a little further, running from the beast.\n You've tried your best, but this doesn't seem like a creature to take down with just two huntresses.\n The reptile roars, carelessly uprooting trees as it pursues you in its frenzy. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] almost get trampled at a certain point, but you manage to push her away in time. The Carnosaur only stops when you jump off a cliff, roughly landing on some trees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen88001;Goddesses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen88002;The Culchan shrieks when [From.GetFirstName] jump from the tree and lands on his back. You are ready to point your spear at him, rising from cover, but the giant bird ignores and tramples you, running away and trying to shake [From.GetFirstName] off.\n She holds onto her spear, sinking it deeper in the back of the Culchan. She's finally thrown off the prey, but rolls easily back on her feet, catching your spear and throwing it right on the creature's flank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen88002;A Naggaront [From.GetFirstName] could handle, but, when she entered the cave, she didn't expect to find a nest. At that point it was too late to call off the attack, the two creatures had already caught her stench.\n She throws a spear at the first, managing to land a lucky shot in its eyes and running for the exit, where you await for her.\n You put down your spears right before the monsters come out, managing to have them impale themselves with their own charge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen88002;You and [From.GetFirstName] run around in circles, yelling at the top of your lungs, but never leaving the safety of the trees as the pack of crazed Stegandons growls and trumpets, trying to find a way out of the fire you started.\n When the stampede finally gets underway, you start throwing spears at them, until you've singled out the weakest reptile. Having slowed the creature down, you jump on its back together, thrusting your spears many times over in the fissure at the back of its neck, under its bone collar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDslizardmen88002;[From.GetFirstName] keeps holding her breath, eyes pointed up as the Terradon slowly approaches the surface of the river to drink. At the last possible moment, she swims out, charging her spear through the creature's chest. The Terradon shrieks, flapping his wings in an attempt to flee.\n [From.GetFirstName] wraps her arms around his neck while you jump on his back and stab him again.\n For a few seconds you are left hanging over the trees, but the Terradon cannot sustain the both of you while wounded and finally crashes down, dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEslizardmen88002;[From.GetFirstName] jumps behind a rock just in time to avoid the jet of fire spitted by the angry salamander. Quickly putting out a spark in her hair, she looks up for you, readying her bow. In the meantime, you, crouched on a tree, are already aiming. The moment you fire, the salamander stops and [From.GetFirstName] leaves cover, shooting a second arrow straight into its mouth.\n The monster jerks and coughs, before trying to get out another firey breath, but at that point [From.GetFirstName] has already managed to get close enough to bury her spear under his neck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

You decided to explore it, but a few steps inside and you are already fending off spiked walls, pit traps and poisonous darts.\n You get separated from [From.GetFirstName] and decided to proceed on your own. Sadly, you don't get very far before remaining stuck in a dead end and have to walk all the way back from where you started. It is at this point that you find [From.GetFirstName], with a golden idol under her arm, fleeing as a giant round boulder rolls down the hall behind her! You barely manage to get out before getting squashed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGslizardmen88002;The Miyans were not amused when you stole all of their game, but what were you supposed to do? You didn't have any luck in finding decent prey.

Sadly, you have to abandon half your load to swim back to the surface, where you quickly run into the wild before the Miyans are able find a way down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHslizardmen88002;You were stalking a smaller lizard when something called. The distraction was enough to catch you off-guard as a poisoned dart pierced your neck. You only manage to spot a couple of shining eyes in the leaves before losing consciousness. \n When you recover, [From.GetFirstName] is carrying you frantically through the jungle, still escaping from the elusive monster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIslizardmen88002;The Kroxigor roars, ignoring the wounds on his side and on his face. He lowers his head and charges you. While you manage to avoid the worst of it, you are still knocked down. [From.GetFirstName] throws her spear at the creature's back while it's charging you, but the Kroxigor just rips the spear out with a grunt and discards it.\n [From.GetFirstName] plants another arrow near his eye, enraging him further, and wait till the last second before jumping away from its feral charge. The Kroxigor ends sticking his horns on the side of a tree. Before he manages to tear it off, she's back with her spear, plunging it again and again in his hide until he finally collapses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAslizardmen88002;That was hard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen88003;You had a lot of fun in this hunt, even though your companion was clearly out of your league. When you returned back at palace, all covered in mud, sweat and blood, all loaded with meat and trophies, you were exhausted, but you felt alive more than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen88003;We should do this more often!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen88004;While not a bad experience, you certainly had quite a few scares during this hunt. If you died, who would have led the Amazons?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen88004;Maybe I'll rest for a while now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC_DOOMENGINE_1006;Chaos has broken through!\n After centuries trying to counteract the consequences of the Polar Gates collapsing, the magical vortex in Ulthuan has failed, the geonetwork of the Slann broke and the stuff of Chaos has flooded the world, drowning all living creatures in madness, death and destruction.\n There is no safe place left, all of the Earth will be consumed by the uncontrolled, devastating energies of the Warp, until nothing is left and Chaos crumbles on itself as well.\n And so the ultimate Fate of the world since the Old Ones left has been accomplished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCasrai54;Spirits attack the supply lines, soldiers are driven insane or just disappear into the wilds. It is clear your troops are not welcomed in the alien glades of Athel Loren.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaosfl1;You're challenge has been issued and so it echoes across the plains: you will organize a great tournament to please Khorne and gain his favour. Any who believes himself worthy of the gaze of Skull God will gather and you will all fight and bleed and kill until only one remains to bask in the triumph of ultimate victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl1;BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCBschaosfl2;Not enough warriors came at your call. The plain lies empty before you, with just some curious cultists roaming around, squabbling over minor quarrels.

[From.GetFirstName] finally manages to break the stall by feinting a thrust and then ramming on you with [From.GetHerHis] shoulder. You drag [From.GetHerHim] on the ground as well, starting to punch and bite [From.GetHerHim], but [From.GetFirstName] is the one to get a firm hold on you in the end, violently snapping your neck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEschaosfl3002;You start the duel confident of your abilities, but you soon realize your opponent is tougher than [From.GetSheHe] appears. [From.GetFirstName] quickly overcomes you, striking you down, dragging you by the neck for all to see, shouting [From.GetHerHis] victory.\n Your shame channels anger even more and you finally find the strength to free yourself of [From.GetHerHis] hold and start choking [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetFirstName] struggles and manages to punch you away, reaching for [From.GetHerHis] blade and cutting your chest open.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFschaosfl3002;A timely charge allows you to push down your opponent at the start of the duel. You jump on [From.GetFirstName], painfully crushing [From.GetHerHis] knees and cutting a gash under [From.GetHerHis] arm.\n Your opponent screams, but [From.GetSheHe] will not admit defeat. Rolling on the side, [From.GetSheHe] throws [From.GetHerHis] weapon at you, striking you on the shoulder. Limping back on [From.GetHerHis] uninjured leg, [From.GetSheHe] tackles you from below, quickly bashing your skull with a rock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGschaosfl3002;Your last strike is so hard, you cut [From.GetFirstName]'s weapon in half. Shouting your imminent triumph, you advance as [From.GetSheHe] retreats.\n You need to accuse [From.GetHerHim] of cowardice several times before [From.GetSheHe] finally stops running and faces you again.\n Using [From.GetHerHis] arms to shield [From.GetHerHim]self, [From.GetSheHe] throws [From.GetHerHis]self at you, ignoring your blows and pushing through to split your head open with [From.GetHerHis] bare hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHschaosfl3002;The cheering of the crowd inhebriates you as you strike and kick your opponent on the ground. The duel might end sooner than you thought, [From.GetFirstName] was easy to disarm and cut down.\n Yet, as you prepare to end [From.GetHerHis] sufferings, [From.GetSheHe] rises up suddenly, stopping your blade with [From.GetHerHis] bare hands and headbutting you. You lose the grip on your weapon in the commotion and soon find the blade sticking out of your side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIschaosfl3002;You both lost your weapons during the fight, but that didn't stop you from continuing, grappling and wrestling on the ground.\n [From.GetFirstName] tries to break your neck, you pierce [From.GetHerHis] eye with a nail, but it's not enough to break [From.GetHerHis] hold on you. Slowly your vision blurs and you exhale your final breath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCLschaosfl3002;When [From.GetFirstName] manages to strike you and draw first blood with a lucky swing, you feel the rage building up inside you. Charging your opponent head-on, you parry [From.GetHerHis] second strike and trample [From.GetHerHim]. \n Before [From.GetSheHe] can get up, you come down on [From.GetHerHim] starting to bit off pieces of [From.GetHerHim].\n [From.GetFirstName] takes hold on [From.GetHerHis] blade and plunges it deeply in the back of your neck, stopping your savage attack and killing you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCMschaosfl3002;[From.GetFirstName] is the first to attack, waving [From.GetHerHis] blade to force you in defence, you dodge and deflect [From.GetHerHis] attacks as fast as you can, ignoring the small cuts and trying to wait for [From.GetHerHim] to lose [From.GetHerHis] thrust.\n Finally, you see an opening and strike, but it's only a feint and [From.GetFirstName] is ready to pass [From.GetHerHis] blade through your chest and smashing your mouth with a punch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl3002;RAAAAAHHHH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaosfl3003;The crowd cheers as you stand over the bloody remains of your defeated opponent, savagely shouting your victory and dedicating the blood tribute to Khorne. Yet, there are more fights to be held, and more challenges for you to be overcome if you wish to truly catch the attention of the Lord of Skulls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl3003;WHO'S NEXT?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaosfl4;You shout and bump your chest, all covered in steeming blood, surrounded by the dozens of challengers fallen in the quest for glory.\n You never doubted your skill, all this great show of prowess and bloodshed is certain to have endeared Khorne to you. \n The crowd cheers and chants your name, in awe and hidden fear, cowering as you leave the field, many even start following you, certain that such a strong leader will bring them closer to the Blood God as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAschaosfl4;MORE DEATH! MORE BLOOD!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaosfl5001;Khorne favours you! Since you emerged victorious from the ordeal, you can hardly even remember the meaning of fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl5001;Fear is for cowards and WEAKLINGS!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaosfl5002;Surviving the deathmatch made you stronger than you ever were. Khorne must have blessed you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl5002;I'm invincible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaosfl5003;Days have passed since you won the tournament, but it doesn't pass a moment when your mind is not filled with thoughts of blood and violence. The blessing of Khorne filled your heart with rage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl5003;RAAAAAHHHH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaosfl5004;You can feel it, more than ever: your victory at the deathmatch did not pass unnoticed in the eyes of the gods. Khorne watches you with approval, new glory awaits you for certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl5004;BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaosfl6001;The Architect of Fate is an unknownable Master. He has taken your offering of blood and trust at the altar of treason, but has repaid you with treason in return. You've killed those that were dear to you, but it'll be all for nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl6001;More, I need more sacrifices;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaosfl6002;You cut down your friends and family one by one, personally, looking them in the eyes as the treasonous act unravels before them, in their last minute of life. As their blood spills on the alter, drops start flying and flickering beside you and soon an entire army of daemons stands ready at your command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl6002;Power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotential2;Since your childhood strange things have kept happening around you. You can't quite put your finger on it, it's nothing concrete, just a vague sensation of weirdness ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential2;I'm a mage! That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBmagicpotential2;Maybe.. Maybe I shouldn't talk about this;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaosfl8;What kind of generous gift should you bestow this time upon [From.GetFirstName], so that [From.GetSheHe] may share in Nurgle's mugnificence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl8;The delicate numbing touch of leprocy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaosfl8;The heart-warming heath of consumption.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaosfl8;The popping joys of the creeping fever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaosfl8;The great kiss of Nurgle's rot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaosfl8001;You wondered why was [From.GetFirstName] spending so much time with you in the past days, but you realize now [From.GetSheHe] was preparing you to unknowningly receive one of Nurgle's gifts as you realize when dead flesh starts falling off your bones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl8001;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaosfl8002;You wondered why was [From.GetFirstName] spending so much time with you in the past days, but you realize now [From.GetSheHe] was preparing you to unknowningly receive one of Nurgle's gifts as you realize when blood starts coming out your lungs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl8002;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaosfl8003;You wondered why was [From.GetFirstName] spending so much time with you in the past days, but you realize now [From.GetSheHe] was preparing you to unknowningly receive one of Nurgle's gifts as you realize when itchy fever-inducing buboes start covering your skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl8003;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaosfl8004;You wondered why was [From.GetFirstName] spending so much time with you in the past days, but you realize now [From.GetSheHe] was preparing you to unknowningly receive one of Nurgle's gifts as you realize when your flesh starts rotting and turning into a sickly green hue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl8004;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60;The poison of the Dragon-Emperor is drying your blood. As more and more time passes since you've stared into the Dark Crystal, you feel your mind slipping into madness and your body collapsing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60;I will gaze into the Jade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires60;I don't need help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60005;You slither into the dark room and your eyes are soon caught by the sickly green glow of the black sphere standing on the pedestal. You are drawn closer to it and stare for days at its dark and smooth surface, letting its unholy power refill your body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60005;I am reborn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60007;It took you a while to realize it, but you've discovered some percious artifacts have disappeared from your treasury. As far as your servants remember, they swear you ordered the items shipped to an unknown location days ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60007;Grmmmhhh;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60008;There is an important matter that requires your attention. You're uncertain how long it will take, but you feel compelled to depart immediately, alongside your servants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60008;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires70001;Your mission brought you far away from your palace, but it's finally over and you feel free to return to the usual business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires70001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires70002;Your mission brought you far away from your palace and to many dangerous places. When you come to your senses, you're in unknown land, grievously injured and barely manage to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires70002;Rrrgh;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires70003;Your mission brought you far away from your palace and to many dangerous places and revealed itself to be too much for you to handle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires70003;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60010;In your mediation your stare cut through the veil of the Dark Crystal itself. You saw the slopes of the Imperial City, the seat from which the Heavenly-Dragons rule over their subjects. Your will truly is divine, for you've catched a glimpse of their power and made it yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60010;I command the Heavensss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60011;You stared deeply into the Dark Crystal and as your power was restored, you glimpsed beyond its veil at wonders beyond the understanding of mortals. There is much to be learned from these ancient artifacts and you are one step closer to unlock their secrets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60011;The sssound of the universe;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60012;You stared deeply into the Dark Crystal and as your power was restored, you glimpsed beyond its veil and saw the lair of the Firebringer. Wandering in the dreams of the ancient dragon, you stared at his works and new wonders were unlocked in your mind as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60012;Cogs and contraptions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60013;You stared for too long in the poisonous depths of the Dark Crystal. The flow of forbidden knowledge bursts through your body, leaving you wrecked on the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60013;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60014;You stared for too long in the poisonous depths of the Dark Crystal. The flow of forbidden knowledge whips your mind, merging thoughts and stealing memories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60014;Aaahhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60015;You stared for too long in the poisonous depths of the Dark Crystal. The flow of forbidden knowledge overwhelms your mind, distorting your perceptions and breaking your senses. You leave the room screaming nonsense and pulling your hair off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60015;The great wyrms see me!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60016;You stared for too long in the poisonous depths of the Dark Crystal. The flow of forbidden knowledge bursts through your body, consuming your mind and turning your flesh into a bright steeming light.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60016;AaaaaAAAAHHH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60017;You starved yourself in your meditation, staring in the depths of the Dark Crystal. In these past days you've seen wondrous and terrible things that you would have never believed in before. You've seen the real gods in their Heavenly Palace across the clouds, there is no denying they are the only creatures worthy of service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60017;For henceforth I pledge myself to the Heavenly Dragons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires71;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] wraps [FromFrom.GetHerHis] coils around you and stares into your eyes, slowly hissing. The unflinching reptilian stare of the Jade pierces into your mind, trying to bend it to [FromFrom.GetHerHis] will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires71;Must.. resist..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires71001;The Jade have fed aplenty upon the worthless inhabitants of [Root.GetName]. The victims have been so many that servants and workers have become rare and the work has slown down there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires71001;How long before those inssects breed some more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires71002;The unsufferable mortals in [Root.GetName] still oppose your dominion over them. The incessant resistance to the Jade's many feasts have further enflamed the spirits there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires71002;They'll learn, one way or another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires72;Is it time once more to feast over the flocks of unworthy mortals, rounding them up, relocating some for further breeding and suck the rest dry in a orderly fashion, as dictated by the rituals of the Imperial Scribe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires72;Yesss, let us proceed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires72;Not yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires72005;No city, fortress or village is left untouched. The swarms of Jade vampires circle around the province, tighteining their coils on any inhabitant they can find, bleeding dry some, turning the most promising and ensnaring the rest to relocate in their palaces as pets and slaves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires72005;The rituals have been upheld.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires72006;No city, fortress or village is left untouched. The swarms of Jade Vampires circle around the province, tighteining their coils on any inhabitant they can find, bleeding dry some, turning the most promising and ensnaring the rest to relocate in their palaces as pets and slaves. This entire land lies empty now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires72006;We'll send the lizardss to fill the void sssoon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires72007;This province seems to offer more resistance than others. Villages have been abandoned before your arrival, villagers attack your guards, try to ambush you during the day, soon you discover this feast has turned into an uprising against your just rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires72007;To armsss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires72008;[FromFromFrom.GetName] has been devoided of anyone for some time, but you finally managed to spare enough sauri to set up a garrison of sorts there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires72008;Until they are also required to sate our thirst;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires73;You've broken the defenses of [From.GetName], this province is filled with healthy cattle and several Jade are eager to take their due from the conquered population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires73;Have at it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires73;Not here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires73001;The merciless undead of [From.GetTitledFirstName] have come to your lands and slaughtered your people. Soldier or commoner is of no difference for them and the few who have not been sucked dry have been enslaved and deported to their mysterious palaces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires73001;Monsters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires73002;The merciless undead of [From.GetTitledFirstName] have come to [FromFrom.GetName] and slaughtered its people. Soldier or commoner is of no difference for them and the few who have not been sucked dry have been enslaved and deported to their mysterious palaces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires73002;Monsters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires74;You've been searching for it for centuries and now you can bask once more in the greenish light of its dark surface. A Dark Crystal for you to stare at once more, to look at the Heavens as you did when you were there, so many centuries ago, and hear the thundering commands of the Dragon Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsvampires74;No longer will your perfect form be ravaged by the twisted curse of the humans: you've found one of the lost Dark Crystals. Through it, you can tap once more in the power of the Heavens and snatch away what is rightfully yours from the greedy pawns of the Celestial Dragons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsvampires74;This is a day of celebrations. After many generations of search, you've found one of the lost Crystals of the Heavens. This relic will bring much honor to your family and endear the Celestial Dragons to your cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDsvampires74;You've spent years searching for it and now it is finally within your grasp: one of the ancient Dark Crystals of Cathay. The fabled jade stone is smooth and pitch black, but a sickly green halo surrounds it, vibrant of the power contained within.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires74;Mine at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires74001;News have reached you [From.GetTitledFirstName] has found one of the fabled Dark Crystals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires74001;I see;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires75;You lose yourself in the dark reflections of the crystals and soon enough the voices of the Celestial Dragons thunder inside your mind. You must proceed further with your sacred duty. Due to your survival and reaffirmed fealthy to the Celestial Throne, you've been granted the lead over a new expedition which shall soon reach your colony. It is your task to proceed further inside Lustria and vanquish the interlopers who would disrupt the delicate work of the Heavenly Dragons by reshaping the earth to their twisted needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires75;So I shall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires75001;It is hard to see the will of the Celestial Dragons, but surely you must have pleased them by eradicating the legacy of the Imperial Scribe and in reconquering the Dragon Isles in their honor.\n They must be pleased with you, for Xen Huong has sent another great army, so that you might expand Cathay's colonial dreams of conquest even further West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires75001;And so it shall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60018;You've spent days gazing into the Dark Crystal and you've seen glimpses of the shining coils of the Dragon-Gods. Zan Long, the Ordainer, the one who determines the tasks and castes, has shared with you a fraction of his ancient knowledge, granting you preternatural eloquence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60018;I am honored by his gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60019;You've spent days gazing into the Dark Crystal and you've seen glimpses of the shining coils of the Dragon-Gods. Yein, the Heavenly Sibling of Conquest, has opened your mind to memories of ancient battles on the grounds and skies of the Fabled Cathay, granting you a deeper insight on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60019;I'll put this knowledge to good use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60020;You've spent days gazing into the Dark Crystal and you've seen glimpses of the shining coils of the Dragon-Gods. Zan Long, the Ordainer, has guided you to the gates of the Celestial Palace and showed you some fragments from the scrolls upon which the laws of the Heavens were written.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60020;I see all so clearly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60021;Your search inside the sickly reflections of the Dark Crystal has led you into somber and cold places. You've seen the great lair of the Sleeping One, Xao Saen, oldest of the Heavenly Dragons, and he has shared fragments of his dreams with you, showing you long-forgotten secrets and tricks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60021;A great gift to keep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60022;You've spent days gazing into the Dark Crystal and you've seen glimpses of the shining coils of the Dragon-Gods. The unending spires of the Heavenly City unravel around you as you float beneath the shadow of Fa Xeng, the Firegiver and most beloved amongst the Cathayans. His mere sight is enough to unlock the potential of your mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60022;So much knowledge;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60023;You've spent days gazing into the Dark Crystal and you've seen glimpses of the shining coils of the Dragon-Gods. Yet, it's in the night and a tick fog that you may see the divine eyes of Xen Huong, Judge of Life and Fate. In the reflection of the terrible eyes of the Dragon-Emperor you see what lies before you and know that you are blessed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60023;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires76;Confirmation has come that the former Imperial Scribe has reached the Heavenly City. The wretched renegate entered its sacred gates, never to leave them again. It is unknown what was the judgement bestowed upon him by Xen Huong, but you are certain this is the last you hear of Shdroi So'sou.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires76;After so many centuries, justice is served.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires76001;Sadly, the corrupted Jade had still enough power to charm his guards and slither away at the moment of your triumph. Shdroi So'sou has escaped justice once more and plots again for your destruction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires76001;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60024;In the dark reflections of the crystal you've found peace and clarity of mind. The glimpse you've catched of the slopes of the Heavens built by the Dragon Gods has placated the voices and restored your sanity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60024;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60025;The wicked taint of Chaos could not bear the poisonous light of the Dark Crystal. As you gazed into it, the corrupted flesh melted away, cleansing your body from he touch of the Warp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60025;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires77;You've broken the Law of Heavens, you no longer care about the edicts of the Dragon-Emperor. Thus, crawl in the darkness, for you shall nevermore set coil peacefully in the Celestial Palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires77;Ssso be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAsvampires78;We don't go here, not makez da Zpider God angry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires78;Ya git! Da zpiderz bring luck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires78001;The signs you sent were enough to scare the meddling greenskins away. They will not dare to linger near the Shadowlands for some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires78001;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires78002;The greenskins ignored your warnings and are still marching closer to the Shadowrealm. Only violence will push them away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires78002;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE23;As the ages pass, you feel closer and closer to your sire. You own eternity to your creator and wish to give eternal love in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE23;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCvampire23001;After decades of existance, you've forged an undeniable bond with your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. Yours will be an eternal love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAvampire23001;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE24;As the ages pass, you feel closer and closer to your sire. You own eternity to your creator and wish to give eternal love in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE24;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE25;You can no longer restrain yourself: your feelings for your beloved have become too strong for you to be separated. You must be with your mate together forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE25;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCvampire25001;[From.GetFirstName]'s love for you has grown to the point [From.GetSheHe] can no longer be without you. Forsaking all reason, your lover swarms on you to embrace you forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAvampire25001;*Allow [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBvampire25001;*Cast [From.GetHerHim] out*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCvampire25002;You weep of joy as you consume [From.GetFirstName]. It is soon done, now you are one with [From.GetHerHim] forever, no longer will you feel alone and longing for [From.GetHerHis] embrace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAvampire25002;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCvampire25003;[From.GetFirstName] has rejected your love. You were wrong: [From.GetSheHe] doesn't care for you and deserves nothing in return but your contempt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAvampire25003;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDR_universities.33;[From.GetFirstName] has excelled beyond your expectations: he has returned from the great university of Martek wielding the holy flames of Ormazd. Having a Scholar in your family will bring great prestige to your dynasty and help in the fight against the darkness in the East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTADR_universities.33;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires79;The Mahtmasi swarmed inside you and the vermin devoured you from inside out for an entire, agonizing night and day. Finally, you rise again. Where first ran blood, now crawls vermin, all life has been sucked out of you and you are reborn as a new Mahtmasi vampire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires79;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires79001;You spent a night inside your victim, drinking their blood from the inside and leaving a new life behind you. Now, this kindred spirit has reborn as a Carrion Child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires79001;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires80;The Mahtmasi swarmed inside you and the vermin devoured you from inside out for an entire, agonizing night and day. It was too much for your body to bear and you collapsed midway through the transformation. As you lay dying on the ground, you can hear the vampire weep over you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires80;Ghh;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires80001;You spent a night inside your victim, drinking their blood from the inside and leaving a new life behind you, but, despite their efforts, their body was not ready to handle the Blood Kiss: when you reemerge the following night, your fledgling is dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires80001;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires81;No Big Bokor exists to link the world of the living with the Shadowrealm. The balance has been broken and the Shadowgate collapses on itself, cutting off the Mahtmasi from their ethereal domain. Never again will the bloodline of Maatmeses hold sway over the people of the Southlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires81;I see;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires81001;The elusive realm of the Shadowmen has been finally destroyed. The tendrils of the Shadowlands have stopped to clutch onto the lands of the Bayaji. Never again will the bloodline of Maatmeses hold sway over the people of the Southlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsvampires81001;The Shadowmen have stopped to answer your prayers and accept your offerings. No witch-doctor has felt their presence for days now, it seems as if they abandoned the Southlands entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires81001;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires81001;I will not abandon them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires81001;They have forsaken us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires82001;You've been convinced by your Bokors that you need some time to meditate and recover from your recent defeat. It is possible another Big Bokor will be more appropriate to fight the current enemies of the Bayaji.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires82001;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83;You've located something close enough to [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] to work the binding magic upon the fetish. Now it's only a question of acquiring the object;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83;My co-conspirators will provide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires.83;I'll make preparations;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires.83;I know exactly what to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsvampires.83;Too risky - I will bide my time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83001;You've located something close enough to your target to interest your mysterious employer. Now it's only a question of acquiring the object;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83001;*Ask the Plot head for funds*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83002;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], is asking for funds to provide you the item you need for the voodoo ritual against [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83002;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires.83002;Even [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] suffreing is not worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83003;[From.GetTitledName] has sent me the necessary funds to acquire one of [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s personal belongings...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83004;[From.GetTitledName] has refused to give you the money asked in return from stealing [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s personal item.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83004;I will pay for it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires.83004;Forget it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83005;After a long and tiring day, you're ready to welcome the embrace of a deep slumber. You leave your court and move to the safety of your chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83005;I'm so tired;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires.83005;What was that shadow!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83006;A thief, lurking in your very chambers! The burglar slips away before you can summon your guards, but you recognize who it is and who sent it. It's hard to spot at first, but later you realize one of your personal items has disappeared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83006;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83007;A thief, lurking in your very chambers! The burglar slips away before you can summon your guards and there's no way of recognizing it. Strangely enough, there doesn't even seem to be anything missing in your rooms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83007;What was he doing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83008;You catch the thief before he can slip away in the shadows again. Soon, the little scoundrel lays on the torture table, gasping the name of his employer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83008;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName].. I wonder what was [FromFrom.GetSheHe] trying to accomplish;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83009;You scare off the thief with your screams, but he slips away in the shadows before you can catch him. At the very least he will go back to his master empty-handed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83009;What could he wanted?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83010;Your co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], has let you know that you will soon receive the item you crave for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83010;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83011;[From.GetTitledName] awaits for your success. [From.GetSheHe] certainly has some dark spell in store for [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83011;*Make the preparations*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83012;[From.GetTitledName] has let you know that the plot to acquire one of [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s personal items is proceeding well.  You should soon receive the final ingredient for your curse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83012;It's about time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83013;Success! [From.GetTitledName] may have discovered your involvement in the burglary, but now your doll is completed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83013;Let the ritual begin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83014;Success!  [From.GetTitledName]'s fate is within your hands and [From.GetSheHe] doesn't even realize it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83014;Let the ritual begin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83015;Failure! [From.GetTitledName] caught the burglar and your complicity in the theft was discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83015;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83016;Failure! [From.GetTitledName] discovered the thief, but was unable to uncover the conspiracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83016;We will just have to try again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires84;You place the little ragdoll on your table and prepare all the other tools. It took some time, but you're finally ready to act upon [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires84;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires84002;You may perform a voodoo curse to afflict [From.GetFirstName] and those near to [From.GetHerHim]. What will you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires84002;*Curse [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetHerHis] lands*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires84002;*Curse [From.GetHerHis] lands*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires84002;*Curse [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsvampires84002;*Annull the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85;Something is wrong. For days now you've had trouble resting. It wouldn't have bothered you as much if you didn't receive news a similar discontent was growing amongst your subjects as well. The people are growing unhappy and susceptible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85;I will fight this evil curse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires85;What is happening?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85001;[From.GetFirstName] was more resourceful than you expected: [From.GetSheHe] fought off your curse and rid [From.GetHerHim]self of its dark influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85001;This was a waste of time;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85002;A grim shadow has covered [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s land. Now it is time to tighten your hold and unleash the true potential of your curse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85002;*Spread darkness and discontent*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires85002;*Summon a plague of locusts*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85003;Whatever dark influence was trying to take hold in your land has been exorcised. You won't have to fear for your life and that of those around you for some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85003;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85100;A shroud of darkness heavies upon all of your lands, weakening your will and the resolve of all your subjects. Crime and discontent are on the rise and people have started whispering there is a curse laid upon you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85100;How can this be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85101;[From.GetFirstName]'s subjects are starting to fear and hate their master as your curse flows through their lands, feeding off of their hopes and happiness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85101;*Keep the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires85101;*End the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85102;Children are born dead, corpses twitch restless in their graves, food spoils before time, water turns into poison Your realm is certainly cursed. An unescapable feeling of crushing defeat heavies upon your soul and that of your subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85102;Will we ever be happy again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85103;[From.GetFirstName]'s lands are wrapped into a thick shroud of defeat and despair, weakening their will and soul. Their children are born dead, corpses twitch restless in their graves, food spoils before time and water turns into poison. Every night dark clouds cover the moons and stars, leaving the scared peasants hiding in their shacks, cold and terrified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85103;*Keep the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires85103;*End the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85104; Every night dark clouds cover the moons and stars, leaving your scared peasants hiding in their shacks, cold and terrified. At every dawn new dead are found, killed by thiefs or rambling lunatics. The curse is spreading in the nearby lands as well, angering your vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85104;We're doomed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85200;It started as nothing, a few missing tributes and unhappy peasants, but now the plague of locust has revealed itself in all it's terrible glory. The vermin has started to swarm over your capital, finding its way into any storage, devouring all of your reserves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85200;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85201;The first swarms have reached [From.GetFirstName]'s capital. From there, they will spread into [From.GetHerHis] entire realm, if allowed to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85201;*Keep the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires85201;*End the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85202;The plague of locusts has spread to all of your lands, growing deadlier every day. The insatiable creatures have started to attack your subjects as well, leaving half-eaten corpses on their wake. The few desperate people who attempt to eat the vermin itself for sustenance discovered it to be poisonous as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85202;What sort of curse is this?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85203;As expected, the plague of locusts has spread to all of [From.GetFirstName]'s lands. Allowing it to grow still will further weaken [From.GetHerHis] realm and anger [From.GetHerHis] subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85203;*Keep the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires85203;*End the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85204;The vermin is everywhere, swarming into every house, biting and carving its way into everything that is not made of stone and metal. If it's not stopped, it will reduce your entire realm into a barren wasteland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85204;What *can* I do!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires86;Something is wrong. There are news of discontent growing amongst your subjects. There is no discernable cause for the unrest within your land, it must be the work of some evil curse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires86;I will fight it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires86;What is happening?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires86002;A grim shadow has covered [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s land. Now it is time to tighten your hold and unleash the true potential of your curse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires86002;*Spread darkness and discontent*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires86002;*Spread a plague*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCsvampires86102;Corpses twitch restless in their graves, food spoils before time, water turns into poison Your realm is certainly cursed. An unescapable feeling of crushing defeat heavies upon the souls of your subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires86102;Will we ever be happy again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCsvampires86104; Every night dark clouds cover the moons and stars, leaving your scared peasants hiding in their shacks, cold and terrified. People refuse to work or flee in terror from your settlements, trying to find a more peaceful existance elsewhere. The curse is spreading in the nearby lands as well, angering your vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires86104;We're doomed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires86200;An insidious disease has started to spread in your palace. You're a the first to cough blood, but soon news of other courtiers reach you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires86200;It's horrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires86201;[From.GetFirstName] has been struck by your disease. Now it's only a question of allowing the sickness to spread around [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires86201;*Keep the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires86201;*End the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires86202;The sickness has spread through many other courtiers and households within your capital. People have started to die in the street, their corpses laying in pools of their own blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires86202;*Cough* *Cough*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires86203;[From.GetFirstName]'s disease has spread to [From.GetHerHis] court and capital. If you continue to maintain the curse, it shall spread out further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires86203;*Keep the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires86203;*End the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires86204;Fewer and fewer people can claim good health in your realm. As time passes, more are found out coughing blood. There is certainty the sickness is not natural and may never stop until all of you are dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires86204;*Cough* *Cough*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87;You wake soaked in sweat. It's hard to describe, but you feel as if being observed, as if someone was holding you, even though you are alone in your chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87;It's dark magic at work! I must dispell it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires87;It's probably nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87002;You hold [From.GetFirstName]'s doll in one hand, picking one of your tools with the other and whispering the incantation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87002;*Pin the doll*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires87002;*Carve the doll's eyes out*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires87002;*Squash the doll*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsvampires87002;Something else;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87004;You hold [From.GetFirstName]'s doll in one hand, picking one of your tools with the other and whispering the incantation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87004;*Cut the doll's genitalia*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires87004;*Boil the doll's head*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires87004;*Bind the doll's heart*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsvampires87004;Thinking again;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87100;You scream in pain as a deep and narrow wound suddenly appears in your flank, swiftly followed by a second one on your chest. There's nobody around you, nothing to defend yourself against, thus you can only lay in torment and endure the shadowy attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87100;Hnnngh..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87101;One after the other, you pin more rusty needles into the voodoo doll, feeling the pain reverberating from [From.GetFirstName] through the raggety fetish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87101;*Continue*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires87101;*Stop the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87200;An sudden excruciating pain cuts through your eyes and into your head. You try to protect your face as blood spills from your now-empty eyesockets. You've been blinded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87200;Aaaargh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87201;You throw away the last eyebutton from the ragdoll, satisfied with your work, with the mental image of [From.GetFirstName] still screaming and bleeding lingering in your head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87201;*Continue*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires87201;*Stop the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87300;No matter how much you feed, you grow weaker every day, puking away whatever you manage to eat. Your body is becoming more and more fragile, consumed by hunger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87300;Ugh;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87301;You tighten the tie around the ragdoll's belly, feeling the unsatiable hunger of Maatmeses passing down on your unwary victim and consuming [From.GetHerHis] body and soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87301;*Continue*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires87301;*Stop the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87400;You awake in your bed, drenched in sweat, with your body shaking in pain. As you try to get up, you discover the sheets are soaked in your blood, pouring in from an open wound between your legs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87400;Aaaaaah!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87401;You give another cut between the tiny legs of the ragdoll and put the scissors away, satisfied with the result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87401;*Continue*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires87401;*Stop the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87500;You can't think, it's as if you're head is about to explode. Thoughts mix together, your blood boils and everyone looks distant and threatening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87500;What was that?! Oh, right;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87501;You keep the head of the doll inside the cauldron for some time, allowing it to fry [From.GetFirstName]'s mind for some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87501;*Continue*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires87501;*Stop the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87600;It feels as if those closer to your are now plotting for your demise. Can you not trust anybody anymore? You loved them, but they all hate you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87600;They deserve only my contempt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87601;Once the doll's name has been properly tied, you feel the love of [From.GetFirstName]'s wither and slowly die under the compulsion of the curse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87601;*Continue*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires87601;*Stop the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires88;Crawling undead things from Beyond come at your call. You relay the silent orders and let them fly away in the night to recover what you require for your spell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires88;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires89;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has forsaken the wisdom of the Akghan and reverted to the barbaric worship of the Shadowmen in [From.GetHerHis] desperation. Will you join [From.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires89;Yes, the Shadowmen must be appeased!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires89;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLEsrandoms2;Sudenburg's Corruption;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms2;For too long Sudenburg has lingered at the edge of the abyss, indolently sliding towards the pit of corruption under the perverted lead of decadent rulers. This once mighty city was built on the very ashes of the heathens burned by the first Knight-Captain to reach Araby, only another great cleansing can save it from eternal damnation.\n You couldn't have come at worst time, if your own predecessor, a Templar of Sigmar, had been corrupted by the vile undead lurking the swamps of Aruk, then anyone could be compromised. As you run through the reports of your Brother-Knights, your main concern is the despicable friendliness the Graf of Sudenburg seems to share with his neighbors of Olohrad. If the ruler Sudenburg openly intermingles with this heathens, is it any surprise his subjects feel so encouraged to walk into the lures of the undead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms2;I will investigate on the Graf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsrandoms2;I will investigate on Olohrad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsrandoms2;I will focus on something else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLEsrandoms2001;The Graf's Son;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms2001;Heathens as they were, the Bretonnian Crusaders at least knew how to face the repulsive lures of witches and warlocks. Not only has Graf Marcellus maintained friendly relationships with the Akghans of Olohrad and the fanatic slavers of Al-Anaim, he has given his own and only son Timo as a husband to the daughter of the Bunda King. \n You are fairly certain the barbarian wife has charmed the heir of Sudenburg in some way. If he's allowed to succeed his father, it could be seen as further encouragement for the peasants to mix the races and acquire the wicked customs of the Southlanders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms2001;It must not be. He must be disposed of, at any cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsrandoms2001;He's still the Graf's son. I'll look for some other way;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLEsrandoms2002;The Witch-Doctors of Olohrad;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms2002;You've spent some time in Olohrad under cover, but your investigation has given you more doubts than clarity. The people of Olohrad seem to believe they are the only defenders against the darkness coming from the South, as if, by using the despicable sorcery of the undead, they were fighting them.\n Such is the hypocricy of sinners. Nevertheless, the Akghani witch-doctors might be a useful source of information against your main foe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms2002;Maybe I can learn something;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsrandoms2002;The very thought is sinful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms2004;You've the chance to talk with [From.GetTitledFirstName] a few times now. You've often doubted [From.GetHerHis] word, believing [From.GetSheHe] was just patronizing you for half the time, possibly seeing through your disguise. Yet, [From.GetSheHe] has proven useful in better understanding the nature of your undead enemies. As misguided as they can be, these witch-doctors have allegedly been fighting the vampires of the Southlands for centuries, it would be unwise to squander their knowledge on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms2004;No, I will not be tempted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsrandoms2004;I suppose I can use them, for the moment;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms3001;[From.GetFirstName] has been disposed of and you can rest easier. With his death, you hope the Graf will be forced to distance himself from Olohrad and the other decadent city-states, restricting trade deals and tightening the borders. All of this will make easier for you to investigate in Sudenburg itself and will help the city in the long term to maintain its identity and purity of faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms3001;Sigmar willing, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms4;Since your birth, a ravenous hunger has filled your mind and cramped your belly. As you are growing, this unending urge seems to be growing even further, regardless of how much you eat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms4;More! More!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsrandoms4;No! I'm sick of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms4001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] seems to be growing to be quite the plump ogre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms4001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms4002;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is eating less then expected. If [From.GetSheHe] continues like this, [From.GetSheHe]'ll be a laughing stock for the tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms4002;This will NOT stand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsrandoms4002;Worse for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms4003;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has not taken well your resistence to hunger. After a good beating, [From.GetSheHe] has started to force you to take your daily portion of meat and then some.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms4003;Bleah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsrandoms5;You've spent a good childhood, taking always as much food as you could and now it well shows as you are one of the largest ogres of your tribe, tough and intimidating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsrandoms5;You might have had some hit and miss during your childhood, but you've certainly tried your best taking as much food as you could. If nothing else, you've certainly grown to be an ogre of a respectable size.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsrandoms5;You didn't care much for appeasing your own hunger, letting other children of the tribe taking the best meat and now it shows. Many in the tribe push you around and laugh at your weakly constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms5;As it should be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsrandoms5;Bah;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms6;Ogre Chieftains are respected for the girth of their belly. As you are of a relatively weak constitution, many of your warriors have come to believe you not to be the better choice for a leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms6;They're wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms7;You take the puny [From.GetFirstName] between your arms and start savagely taking chomps off of the poor screaming creature until only a few polished bones remain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms7;*Burp*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCskavens1002;Most excellent news, o Great Leader! Your seed has brought forth a tough and most vicious black ratling! It will grow into a most powerful and strongest Stormvermin or a most cunning and shadowy Assassin, for sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAskavens1002;Good-good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCskavens1003;The Horned Rat blesses you, most Excellent Commander! A white-furred ratling has come out of one of your breeders. It will grow-grow into one of the most exalted and wisest prohets of the Underempire, a Grey Seer-Seer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAskavens1003;Yes-yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCskavens1004;Your horns have grown and your powers developed, tuned after a strenous and deadly training with other would-be Grey Seers. Now now you're ready to take your rightful place-place as a most illustrious and great-magnificent spiritual guide of the Skaven: a Grey Seer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAskavens1004;The Horned Rat speaks through me-me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vermin_cast_title;Verminlore;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vermin_cast_desc;The Horned Rat sends his greetings, yes-yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vermin_level1_opt;Skitterleap;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vermin_level2_opt;Warp Lightning;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vermin_level3_opt;Howling Warpgale;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vermin_level4_opt;Vermintide;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCskavens2;You're so tired, why haven't you achieved all you promised yourself to-to? Wasn't the world yours to command?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAskavens2;No no! Not my time yet! I'm the best Skaven ever! I can't d-!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCskavens3;Warpstone is the most precious thing in the world, yes-yes! Eating it will give you power, magical power, more than any surface thing can dream of!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAskavens3;*Eat all shards*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBskavens3;*Eat four shards*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCskavens3;*Eat three shards*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDskavens3;*Eat two shards*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEskavens3;*Eat one shard*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires91;You thought you would share eternity with your lover, but not that you would share your lover with others. This must stop, either it's yours only or nobody's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires91;Give ultimatum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires91;I can share;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires91001;[From.GetFirstName] is tired of sharing you with your other lovers. Either you pick [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetHerHim] only to the end of times, or [From.GetSheHe] will leave forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires91001;Of course I love you only!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires91001;There's the door.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires91002;[From.GetFirstName] lied to you: [From.GetSheHe] never really loved, [From.GetSheHe] would rather spend [From.GetHerHis] days wrapped in the cold arms of other undead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires91002;I HATE you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires91003;[From.GetFirstName] understood [From.GetHerHis] error and promised you to send all of [From.GetHerHis] other lovers away and be with you to the end of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires91003;Finally alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires91004;The vicious [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has managed to charm [FromFrom.GetHerHis] way into convincing your beloved [From.GetFirstName] to leave you for [FromFrom.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires91004;I'll make [FromFrom.GetHerHim] regret it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCskavens1006;This ratling might be of some use for your great plan of world domination, o Great Leader! What should be done with him so that he might serve you in all of his insignificance?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAskavens1006;*Groom as an Elite Stormvermin*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBskavens1006;*Groom as a Master Moulder*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCskavens1006;*Groom as a Plaguelord*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDskavens1006;*Groom as a Master Assassin*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEskavens1006;*Groom as a Warlock-Engineer*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFskavens1006;No-no! This ratling is useless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCskavens1007;After long training, you've become a fierce Stormvermin, ready to fight and kill-kill and eventually rise through the other warlords and becoming the greatest Skaven ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAskavens1007;Yes-yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCskavens1008;After long studying you've been blessed by the decaying touch of the Horned Rat, thus fully becoming a Plaguelord, ready to spread the devastating plagues of your lord and eventually rise through the other warlords and becoming the greatest Skaven ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAskavens1008;Yes-yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCskavens1009;After long studying and experimenting, you've become a rightly-feared Master Moulder, capable of creating all sorts of nightmarish warbeast to help you in your road to glory, allowing you to eventually rise through the other warlords and becoming the greatest Skaven ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAskavens1009;Yes-yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCskavens1010;After long training in the dark you've become one of the sneakiest deadlyest assassins of the prestigious Clan Eshin. Your dark skills will be of great use to your employers and yourself, as you prepare to kill your way to the top and eventually rise through the other warlords and becoming the greatest Skaven ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAskavens1010;Yes-yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCskavens1011;After long studying and experimenting, you've become a respected and feared Warlock-Engineer, capable of twisting magic and tecnology together, powering deadly warmachines with the glowing energies of Warpstone. These creations will surely help you fulfill your destiny, to eventually rise through the other warlords and becoming the greatest Skaven ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAskavens1011;Yes-yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCskavens1012;Some of your masters, clearly envious of your potential, have conspired to undermine your training and force you to fail. Of course, this is but a minor setback: you will reach the position of absolute power you deserve, eventually;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAskavens1012;Soon-soon.. Soon-soon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCskavens1013;Some of your masters, clearly envious of your potential, have conspired to plot your demise before you could finish your training and overthrow them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAskavens1013;Yeaaargh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCskavens4;We Skaven of [From.GetName] surely agree with you, o Most Cunning and Generous Leader! Clearly the ways of your Clan are the most enlightnened and fated to succeed, especially under your wisest guide, yes-yes! Our only desire is to serve-lick you, o most magnanimous and intelligent Master!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAskavens4;That's better-well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCskavens7;A most precious piece of pure warpstone has been recovered from one of your mines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAskavens7;Mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBskavens7;Don't care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_asurdebate_12;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has approached you, saying [FromFrom.GetSheHe] will forget what you owe [FromFrom.GetHerHim], where you to change your political stance and align it to [FromFrom.GetHerHis].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_asurdebate_12;Hmpf.. I see. Very well then;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_asurdebate_12;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv22;All able-bodied young Naggarothi are expected to serve the Witch King in the Black Guard army for a hundred-years draft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv22;I will ask permission to my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv22001;All able-bodied young Naggarothi are expected to serve the Witch King in the Black Guard army for a hundred-years draft. [From.GetFirstName] has reached the proper age, the officers from Naggarond will soon come to take [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv22001;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBdruchiiinv22001;I can convince them to do otherwise;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv22002;[From.GetFirstName] has not opposed the Witch King's edict. It is time for you to depart and join the Black Guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv22003;[From.GetFirstName] has used bribes and threats against the Naggarondi officiers to prevent you from leaving court. It seems you shall avoid the draft entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv22003;I see;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv22004;Your draft has finally come to an end. In this years you've come to trust and rely on the men of your regiment, will you abandon them to resume your duties as a Naggarothi nobleman or will you stay in the Black Guard forever?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv22004;I will stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBdruchiiinv22004;Enough of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv22005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has decided that he will never return, taking his place as a Black Guard permanently in the army of the Witch King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv22005;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv22006;The training in the army is no less cutthroat than the rest of druchii society. Sadly it appears you did not have what it takes to be a Black Guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv22006;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has felt the call of Khaine and decided to become a Witch Elf. As Khaine is a jealous god, she won't be able to marry anyone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBdruchiiinv23;I won't allow this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23001;You have devoted yourself to the Lord of Murder, giving away your possessions and proclaiming yourself to be his bride. In these following years you shall train and learn the rites and secrets of the Witches, so that you may better serve your master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23001;For Khaine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23002;Years have passed, but, despite your fervor, you were judged lacking in the eyes of the Lord of Murder. A Khainite Assassin has been sent to dispose of you and, as the lights go out, you are made aware in a cold whisper that you have failed your god.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23002;Hghhh;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23003;For years you have trained and bathed in the blood of your enemies, offering their beating hearts at the altar of Khaine. The Lord of Murder looks favourably upon you and the other Witch Elves have come to see you as a respected member of their coven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23003;As they should.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23004;No mercy and no love. The Lord of Murder beckons death and suffering and in the rivers of blood shed in his honor, you cannot feel anything but excitement and anticipation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23004;Their screams are like music.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23005;The horrors and peril in the church of Khaine have ironed your soul and sharpened your senses. You no longer feel fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23005;Only you should be afraid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23006;The constant strain of the savage rituals and the blood-soaked campaigns have made you stronger and faster than the ordinary elf. Few can hold their own against you in a duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23006;Their blood for my strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23007;Khaine rules over death, none can escape his grasp, neither the greatest warrior nor the wisest sorcerer, all pay tribute to the Lord of Murder in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23007;For Khaine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23008;Working with blades and daggers day and night can certainly leave the mark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23008;Each scar brings glory to Khaine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23009;All Witches are Khaine's brides. He is a jealous god and does not tolerate any man to touch them. Yet, you've found there's another kind of solace to be found in his halls, warmer and softer than what the god's statue can provide;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23009;Hmm;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23010;Through discipline and training, your mind resonates, touched by the sublime designs of the Lord of Murder, and opens to new strategies and dreams of slaughter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23010;Show me the way;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23011;In the frenzy of last night's ritual, some of your sisters were overcome by Khaine's bloodlust and attacked you. Unable to resist to all of them, you barely managed to survive, albeit seriously wounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23011;Grrnpfh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23012;Death and blood course through your veins, you can hear Khaine's voice whispering to you, telling you of his next victims, sharpening your will and senses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23012;I'm ready to do your bidding, o Lord of Murder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv24001;The Witch Elves come at night, silent and deadly, but it is not your blood they seek. Snatched from your palace, you're brought shrieking at the Alter of Khaine and baptised in blood. You shall live with the brides of the Lord of Murder and become an Assassin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv24001;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv24002;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been kidnapped! The Witch Elves sneaked in at night and took the infant from [From.GetHerHis] crib. Though many children do not survive in the church of Khaine, [From.GetFirstName] might be skilled and blessed enough to do so and grow into a deadly Assassin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv24002;For the glory of Khaine;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate13;Dearest [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nWith this missive, I invite you at a great symposium I will be hosting in a few days in my villa. It will be an exquisite reunion, with sublime music and some of the noblest scions of our enlightened kin. It would be grand to count you amongst us.\n\nAwating your confirmation,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate13;It would be rude to not join them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate13;I don't care for such things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate13001;An otherwordly music fills the air as the first guests arrive to your private party, followed by servants and courtiers. The beautiful and pristine sights of Ulthuan surround the private villa you've gathered in, enveloping your guests in the bright and delicate artwork of Asur sculptors and carpenters, each detail refined beyond measure through magic and supreme skill.\n It doesn't take long for you to spot [From.GetFirstName], but still, you decide to not approach [From.GetHerHim] immediately, exchanging pleasantries with the other guests and making sure all the servants are fulfilling their tasks appropriately before making your move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate13001;Just a few minutes still;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate13002;An otherwordly music fills the air as you reach[From.GetFirstName]'s private party alongside some of the other guests, followed by servants and courtiers. The beautiful and pristine sights of Ulthuan surround the private villa you've gathered in, enveloping you in the bright and delicate artwork of Asur sculptors and carpenters, each detail refined beyond measure through magic and supreme skill.\n It doesn't take long for you to spot [From.GetFirstName], but still, [From.GetHerHim] doesn't approach you immediately, busy with [From.GetHerHis] duties as a guest. It is only after some time that you're formally greeted by your host, who, after a few pleasantries, asks to have a word with you in private.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate13002;Very well;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate13003;You've finally approached [From.GetFirstName] and, after exchanging a few pleasantries, have managed to take [From.GetHerHim] aside to have some time to speak in private, far from any unwanted listeners.\n It is time for you to make clear your intentions and negotiate whatever deal you have in mind for your special guest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate13003;*Ask for money*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate13003;*Ask for favor*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasurdebate13003;*Ask to cancel favor*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDasurdebate13003;*Persuade to divorce*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEasurdebate13003;*Propose for marriage*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFasurdebate13003;*Attempt public shaming*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate13004;Kind [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nWith the utmost shame, I must inform you pressing matters have come up and the Fates seem to have conspired to keep me away from your excellent care.\n\nHoping to receive news,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate13004;Slime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate14001;How much will you be asking [From.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate14001;As much as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate14001;A considerable sum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasurdebate14001;Just a small token of affection;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasurdebate14002;[From.GetFirstName] talks with you for quite a long time and does not shy away from showering you with kind and elaborate words to weave your virtues. Yet, as the discussion goes on, you start to see how [From.GetSheHe] is hinting more and more to something that you might do in exchange of [From.GetHerHis] eternal gratitude.\n It seems to be a matter concerning money. Such a base request, yet weaved by such delicate words... It might even be more agreeable, if the sum hinted at was not so outrageous...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Such a base request, yet weaved by such delicate words... To hear your host, it wouldn't even be much for you to be relieved of, to the point you wouldn't even miss what was so graciously given.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate14002;Of course I shall help you, no need to say anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate14001;A favor for a favor, perhaps?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasurdebate14001;Maybe we could consider this a dowry?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDasurdebate14002;I'm afraid I cannot give what you ask for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate14003;In true princely fashion, [From.GetFirstName] has decided to liberally give you the money you needed, without asking anything in return. This public display of opulence has certainly endeared [From.GetHerHim] in the eyes of all the guests, but, more importantly, has allowed you to obtain exactly what you desired, without doing anything in return.\n You can do nothing but profusely thank the gentle guest and continue the evening with the rest of your noble kin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate14003;Perfect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate14013;In true princely fashion, you've decided to liberally give you the money [From.GetFirstName] needed, without asking anything in return. This public display of opulence has certainly endeared you in the eyes of all the guests, in a show of prestige that shall not be soon forgotten.\n [From.GetFirstName] can do nothing but profusely thank you for your generosity and finally allow you to enjoy in peace and kindness the remainder of the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate14013;It was worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasurdebate14004;You've done your best to expose your case as gently and as obscurely as possible: to just ask for money to your kin would be disgraceful. Sadly, while [From.GetFirstName] seems to have understood what you require, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't seem to be willing to depart from it without asking something in return. The guest has remembered that [From.GetSheHe] rightfully owes you something for past allowances and is ready to fulfill [From.GetHerHis] charge, provided that, with this gesture, you will consider [From.GetHerHis] standing charge fulfilled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasurdebate14004;You've done your best to expose your case as gently and as obscurely as possible: to just ask for money to your kin would be disgraceful. Sadly, while [From.GetFirstName] seems to have understood what you require, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't seem to be willing to depart from it without asking something in return. The guest is not clear about it, yet that is something to be expected.\n You might be able to reach an agreement with [From.GetHerHim], provided you promise to support [From.GetHerHim] in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate14004;As you prefer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate14004;I cannot accept this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate14014;[From.GetFirstName] seems to be happy to consider this a meaningful favor on your part and therefore you are happy to readily give [From.GetHerHim] the sum [From.GetSheHe] needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate14014;Be sure to kindly remember this in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate14024;It seems [From.GetFirstName] is not willing to recognize the weight of the boon you were ready to give [From.GetHerHim]. You have therefore no other choice but to withdraw your request entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate14024;How unfortunate we could not reach an agreement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate14005;You've done your best to expose your case as gently and as obscurely as possible: to just ask for money to your kin would be disgraceful. Sadly, while [From.GetFirstName] seems to have understood what you require, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't seem to be willing to depart from it without asking something in return. In more occasions [From.GetSheHe] has stated [From.GetSheHe] will be willing to sustain a spouse in all things and has spared no compliments in regards of your beauty and virtue. It seems clear what [From.GetSheHe] asks in return for [From.GetHerHis] help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate14005;So be it, I'll marry you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate14005;This I will not do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate14015;Outstanding such a crass matter resolved in such a sublime way: before all the guests, you and [From.GetFirstName] declare your love for each other. A priestess is readily called to seal the deal and allow [From.GetFirstName] to receive what [From.GetSheHe] needed from you immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate14015;O joyous day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate14025;Sadly, [From.GetFirstName] doesn't seem to share your interest in [From.GetHerHim] and has refused your proposal. At this point, you are left with no choice but to withdraw your support as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate14025;Maybe [From.GetSheHe]'ll change [From.GetHerHis] mind in a few centuries;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate14006;You could understand if [From.GetFirstName] requested something in return for granting [From.GetHerHis] help, but to refuse entirely? What a crude thing to do. It will certainly not pass leaving [From.GetHerHis] reputation unscathed, but sadly there is nothing else you can do for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate14006;How rude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAasurdebate15;Very well, I'll allow it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate15;In exchange for a favor, maybe something more concrete?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasurdebate15;I would help in every way my spouse;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCasurdebate15001;In true princely fashion, [From.GetFirstName] has decided to liberally promise you support in whatever issue you shall see fit, without asking anything in return. This public display of kindness has certainly endeared [From.GetHerHim] in the eyes of all the guests, but, more importantly, has allowed you to obtain exactly what you desired, without doing anything in return.\n You can do nothing but profusely thank the gentle guest and continue the evening with the rest of your noble kin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate15001;Perfect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate15011;In true princely fashion, you've decided to liberally give you support [From.GetFirstName] needed, without asking anything in return.

EVTOPTAasurdebate15011;It was worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasurdebate15002;You've done your best to expose your case as gently and as obscurely as possible: to just ask for political support to your kin would be disgraceful.

EVTOPTAasurdebate15012;I will put your generosity to good use in the meantime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate15022;It seems [From.GetFirstName] is not willing to recognize the weight of the boon you were ready to provide [From.GetHerHim] with. You have therefore no other choice but to withdraw your request entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCasurdebate15003;You've done your best to expose your case as gently and as obscurely as possible: to just ask for political support to your kin would be disgraceful.

In more occasions [From.GetSheHe] has stated [From.GetSheHe] will be willing to support a spouse in all things and has spared no compliments in regards of your beauty and virtue. It seems clear what [From.GetSheHe] asks in return for [From.GetHerHis] help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate15003;So be it, I'll marry you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate15003;This I will not do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate15013;Outstanding such a shadowy matter resolved in such a sublime way: before all the guests, you and [From.GetFirstName] declare your love for each other.

EVTOPTAasurdebate15013;O joyous day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate15023;Sadly, [From.GetFirstName] doesn't seem to share your interest in [From.GetHerHim] and has refused your proposal. At this point, you are left with no choice but to withdraw your support as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAasurdebate16;You make very good points;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate16;How much is my happiness worth to you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasurdebate16;If I concede to this, will you help me later?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDasurdebate16;This is outrageous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate16001;Your argument was such, that [From.GetFirstName] was completely swayed by it and decided to publically denounce [From.GetHerHis] spouse in front of all the guests. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate16001;Good, Good;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate16011;The points made by [From.GetFirstName] were certainly valid. Denouncing publicly your spouse might have gained you some bad reputation, but you're certain it will all soon passed as other realize the righteousness of your decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCasurdebate16021;What a disgrace. Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has decided to publicly denounce and forsake you as a spouse. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] was wayed by the poisonous words coming from the slithering tongue of [FromFrom.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate16021;Cursed them both.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCselfmarriage1005;You've taken up the task of courting [From.GetFirstName], hopefully one day managing to take [From.GetHerHis] hand in marriage. How should you proceed next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage1005;I shall hunt rare games for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage1005;I shall gift [From.GetHerHim] the most precious items of my garden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCselfmarriage1005;I will show [From.GetHerHim] exquisite pleasures such as [From.GetSheHe] has never seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDselfmarriage1005;I shall give [From.GetHerHim] access to my vast library.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage2;[From.GetFirstName] has spent the past months drowning you in presents and gifts of all sorts, hoping to receive attention from you. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage2;I do like presents;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage2;What a waste of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage2001;You spent a lot on [From.GetFirstName] but it certainly seems [From.GetSheHe] appreciated many of your gifts. Showing to be a dependable partner is certainly fundamental to put the basis of a relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage2001;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage2002;Despite your efforts and expenses [From.GetFirstName] has not looked interested in any way to any of the presents you've riddled [From.GetHerHis] home in the past weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage2002;Hmpf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage3;[From.GetFirstName] has tried many times in the past weeks to show off [From.GetHerHis] influence and power. You've had many acquaintances talk of [From.GetHerHim] in a throughly positive light and telling you what a wonderful spouse [From.GetSheHe]'d make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage3;That is true;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage3;Not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage3001;Your attempt at impressing [From.GetFirstName] has worked flawlessly: you had to call in several favors and subtly have your friends work their ways into [From.GetHerHis] circle of acquaintances to tell [From.GetHerHim] what a wonderful partner you'd make, but it was worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage3001;Yes, it was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage3002;Your attempt at impressing [From.GetFirstName] seems to have fallen flat: despite all the favors you had to call in from friends and relatives, nobody was able to convince [From.GetHerHim] of your good intentions and noble birth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage3002;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage4;[From.GetFirstName] has sent you another poem. You've lost count by now of how many sweet words [From.GetSheHe] has written for you in delicate and moving style.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage4;That is sweet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage4;How tedious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage4001;You've spent weeks writing rhymes to [From.GetFirstName], and [From.GetSheHe] finally has started to mellow down on you. It was a lot of work, but you seem to have caught [From.GetHerHis] attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage4001;Outstanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage4002;All the sleepless nights spend writing poems to the sweet [From.GetFirstName] appear to have been for naught: [From.GetSheHe] remains cold to your delicate verses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage4002;Hm;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage5;From shows of light and illusions to work of art impossible to create for the most skilled craftsman, [From.GetFirstName] has given you quite a show of [From.GetHerHis] magical powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage5;I'm impressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage5;That's somewhat irresponsible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage5001;[From.GetFirstName] has certainly been impressed by the spells and incantations you worked on for [From.GetHerHim], weaving wind after wind to catch [From.GetHerHis] attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage5001;Outstanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage5002;Not even the Winds of Magic seem to catch [From.GetFirstName]'s attention. Your many attempts at impress [From.GetHerHim] with your magic have come to nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage5002;How can one not appreciate the Art!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage6;[From.GetFirstName] has been cornering you at every occasion, whispering sweet nothings in your ear and leading you in the most compromising places. You've resisted [From.GetHerHis] advances until now, but is it really worth it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage6;Let's do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage6;Maybe later on;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage6001;[From.GetFirstName] couldn't have resisted for much longer. You've used all your skills in the past weeks to charm and seduce [From.GetHerHim] and your effort has finally given its fruits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage6001;Marvelous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage6002;You've used all the tricks you had, but [From.GetFirstName] appears immune to your charms. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe]'s not really interested in the physical aspect of the future relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage6002;What else then?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage7;[From.GetFirstName] has sent you another exotic fur, fashioned after [From.GetHerHis] last kill. This suitor has spent the last week overflowing your home with trophies of [From.GetHerHis] hunts, all made in your honor, according to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage7;It's beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage7;So many wasted lives;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage7001;[From.GetFirstName] has been captivated by the trophies you've sent [From.GetHerHim] in the past days, result of your hard work in the wilderness. In fact, you've heard from multiple sources of [From.GetHerHim] wearing some of your furs in public.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage7001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage7002;[From.GetFirstName] has not even pretended to accept your last trophy, sending the fur back with a polite request to stop your endeavours in the wilderness. It seems like this is not something [From.GetSheHe]'s interested in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage7002;I see;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage8;Another ravishing bouquet has been sent by [From.GetFirstName]. There have been several in the past days, accompanied by invitations to [From.GetHerHis] villa as well. You're wondering if it would be proper to accept at this point;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage8;It does look enchanted;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage8;I have no time for this frivolousness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage8001;[From.GetFirstName] has finally accepted your invitation to visit your gardens at the villa. You guide [From.GetHerHim] across the colorful landscape and soon captivate [From.GetHerHim] with the wonders you've grown within.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage8001;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage8002;[From.GetFirstName] continues to ignore your floreal presents and the invitations to the villa. According to [From.GetHerHim] it is not a good period, but it might be that [From.GetSheHe] just doesn't like your flowers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage8002;I should try something else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage9;More than once in the past weeks [From.GetFirstName] has managed to drag you into some obscene, wild party which has left you sickly and confused at every morning. At first it looked unbearable, but now you've starting to see how this kind of entertainment could be something of an acquired taste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage9;See you again tonight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage9;Enough of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage9001;You've managed to sneak [From.GetFirstName] into more than one wild party in the last few weeks. At first [From.GetSheHe] didn't seem to appreciate your companionship, but [From.GetSHeHe] has since then started to like celebrating excess alongside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage9001;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage9002;You've attempted to sway [From.GetFirstName] with wild feasts and intoxicating philters, but [From.GetSheHe] doesn't seem interested in your kind of entertainment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage9002;Drats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage10;[From.GetFirstName] is certainly meek for a suitor, if [From.GetSheHe] is a suitor at all. In the past week, [From.GetSheHe] has only been interested in spending time reading with you and talking about the ancient legends of your race.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage10;It is all so interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage10;What a bore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage10001;You've spent days with [From.GetFirstName], nosedived in old tomes and ancient scrolls, studying the history of your great heritage. There is so much you seem to have in common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage10001;Did you read this one yet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage10002;Your attempts at showing some ancient elven scrolls to [From.GetFirstName] have failed, no differently from many other similar gifts. It might be [From.GetSheHe] isn't very interested in ancient elven literature;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage10002;How can that be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage11112;Before you make your proposal official, you should decide what kind of union are you hoping for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage11112;A Regular Marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage11112;A Matrilineal Marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage11;Even though you barely had time to truly know each other, [From.GetFirstName] has decided to propose [From.GetHerHim]self to you officially, hoping for a matrilineal union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBselfmarriage11;You've been courted by [From.GetFirstName] for some time, hence [From.GetHerHis] proposal of matrilineal marriage does not really come as a surprise to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCselfmarriage11;Even though you barely had time to truly know each other, [From.GetFirstName] has decided to propose [From.GetHerHim]self to you officially, hoping for a regular union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDselfmarriage11;You've been courted by [From.GetFirstName] for some time, hence [From.GetHerHis] proposal of regular marriage does not really come as a surprise to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage11;Before answering, I must consult my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage11;I could never disobey my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage11001;[From.GetFirstName] was ready to accept your proposal. Not that there was ever any doubt about it: a courtier can hardly oppose the decision of [From.GetHerHis] rightful liege. A great ceremony will soon be held and the priestesses shall bind you in marriage, formalizing your union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage11001;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage12;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] has come to you to inform you that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has formally proposed to [FromFrom.GetHerHim] and, as you are [FromFrom.GetHerHis] legal guardian, is coming to ask your permission to make this matrilineal marriage official.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBselfmarriage12;Your suitor, [From.GetFirstName], has decided to propose formally to you, asking your hand in matrilineal marriage. The time has come to decide whether you want to spend the rest of your long life with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCselfmarriage12;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] has come to you to inform you that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has formally proposed to [FromFrom.GetHerHim] and, as you are [FromFrom.GetHerHis] legal guardian, is coming to ask your permission to make this regular marriage official.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDselfmarriage12;Your suitor, [From.GetFirstName], has decided to propose formally to you, asking your hand in regular marriage. The time has come to decide whether you want to spend the rest of your long life with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage12;I accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage12;I cannot allow it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage12001;You are heartened to hear [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s answer to your proposal. A great ceremony will soon held to bind you and your newfound soulmate in marriage and formalize your union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage12001;I'm so happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage12002;Sadly, [From.GetFirstName] doesn't seem to share your feelings for [From.GetHerHim] and has refused your proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage12002;How could you?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage13;Many elves come to partecipate at your wedding ceremony, congratulating both with you and your spouse, discussing politics and listening to the soave music in the air. The priests of many gods have come to celebrate your union, bestowing bestowing blessings of fertility from Isha on the bride, auguries of fortune from Lileath, advices of steady conduct to please Asuryan, promises of riches from Vaul and predictions of long life from Morai-heg. Offerings are brought to each of the shrines as you walk by them and receive the gods' blessings, binding you each time further together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage13;And so we shall be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage13001;The promise of life can only be bought by the certainty of death.\n You and your spouse raise the beating heart of the sacrifice to the shrine of Khaine and let it burn under the unforgiving gaze of the Lord of Murder, in the hopes it'll placate his thirst and allow your union to bear fruit. Only a few selected guests are honored with an invitation, dutifully kept afar and secretly watched by crossbowmen, ready to act at the first suspicious movement. Once the first ceremony is finally over, you leave the temple with your spouse, ready to make an ever more gruesome and enticing ritual to satisfy Atharti.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage13001;The gods watch us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage13002;There is a time for everything. As you reach the spring of this cycle, you are united with your spouse, but, as all Asrai know, this time will someday pass and you shall be separated. In your marriage, you embody, in a small part, the sacred union of Isha and Kurnous and, like them and like all things, your happiness now will find balance in future sorrow. This is what the forest spirit remembers you as it gives its blessing and binds you together. Yet, as all cycles pass, you shall accept the nature of things with a light heart and do the best of what you have right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage13002;We will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdwarfmarriage1001;[event_target:suitor.GetFirstName] has declared [event_target:suitor.GetHerHis] interest for a possible union between the two of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
