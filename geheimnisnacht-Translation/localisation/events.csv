startup0desc;At the dawn of time, it is said that the two Old Ones battled to decide what would be the laws upon which the Universe revolves. Unable to reach a consensus, they split Reality in half, so that those who sought canon over freedom and their opposites could both be pleased by inscribing their preference upon this magic tablet...\n\nThere are two ways to play the Warhammer mod. Option A: Player cannot marry outside of his race, and no one can switch to another race's religion. Option B: Player only (not AI) can marry outside of his race, and with some notable exceptions, it is possible for races to change religions. Way of Life DLC seductions are also less restrictive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
startup0A;A - I want a purely canon experience;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
startup0B;B - I value player choice over canon sometimes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

temptation.1;The Embrace of Uncle Nurgle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.1_desc;The Plague Father, Fly Lord, Great Corrupter, the Master of Pestilence... Grandfather Nurgle has many titles. Within your very mind and soul you hear the maddened buzzing of a billion flies, and a chorus of choking, coughing voices whispering in your ears. They are calling you to join them in the endless bliss of utter pestilence and decay, to cast aside the facade of health and embrace the utter rottenness that is the inevitable fate of all life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Temptation.1.TOOLTIP1;Father Nurgle loves his children, hehehe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Temptation.1.TOOLTIP2;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] will give me the strength to resist this sickness in my heart!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.2;The Seductions of the Prince of Pleasure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.2_desc;Truth, beauty, honour, justice... what do any of these things mean without pleasure? Are not the senses of Man his guide into the divine? Poetry, music, dance, wine, none of it is enough for one of your intellect and needs. Your body and mind yearn for stimulation, to seek out new experiences. You tire of the restraints of so-called "civilised society,and wonder if it might be better to seek out like-minded spirits and experiment with a new lifestyle beyond mere mortal hedonism? Your inquiring mind and almost uncontrollable lust for life leads you to the Forbidden Lord of Excess, Slaanesh, who can offer you all you desire in return for so little?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.2.TOOLTIP1;Ah, what sweet ecstasy is this? I must have more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.2.TOOLTIP2;No, no, I have gone too far... [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] forgive me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.3;The Changer of Ways Calls Ye;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.3_desc;The ignorant masses cling to their Gods and laws, unaware of their own utter insignificance in the grand scheme of things. Civilisations and races rise and fall, the only constant is change - all else is illusion. One of your genius knows that the only way to survive and achieve greatness on this mortal coil is to understand the vast immaterial power of magic, and to use any means necessary to acquire that knowledge. You know that the parlour tricks of the common wizards are merely a pale reflection of the incredible powers that close-minded religious dogma denies to you. In order to better understand the Winds of Magic, and to further your own career, you've considered entering a purely temporary relationship with the daemon called Tzeentch in order to use him for your own ends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
temptation.3.TOOLTIP1;Knowledge is power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.3.TOOLTIP2;Some secrets must be hidden forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.4;The Eight-Fold Path;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.4_desc;Weakness, all you see around you is weakness and corruption. Peace breeds excess, only war is pure. Every day you spend you long for the clash of arms, the splatter of fresh blood on your face, to see your enemies' homesteads in flames and their warriors in flight. Better that than to forever be surrounded by whining, ungrateful vassals and forced to listen to the false advice of effete scholars and sorcerers. Kill them, kill them all! Khorne, Master of the Skull Throne, calls you to his service. It matters not from whence the blood flows, only that it does.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

temptation.5;The Power of Chaos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.5_desc;Everywhere those in power seek to blind the teaming mass of Mankind to the horrors that lurk just out of sight. The Blood God, the Changer of Ways, the Prince of Pleasure and the Great Corrupter are all names for a unspeakable force that was ancient when the mountains and the seas were young. Fools deny it, but the Ruinous Powers are very real. Those who serve them well are rewarded, or else are damned for eternity. Do you dare sell your soul to Chaos Undivided, the Primordial Annihilator - and risk all for the sake of immortality and an escape from death itself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.5.TOOLTIP1;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap]? Bah, these are the real Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.5.TOOLTIP2;My faith in [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] in unshakeable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.6;The Cult;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.6_desc;You hurry through the streets, scurrying like a common criminal through the backstreets and the slums, a hood obscuring your face from sight. But you are no common thief or mere conspirator, you serve a greater power. You duck and weave your way to arranged meeting place, whispering a password in a forbidden language. Inside, you are greeted by your new brothers and sisters, and after a blood curdling ritual test you are finally inaugurated into the cult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_1;With the help of other acolytes and children of the Plaguefather, you have succeeded in placing several artifacts of Nurgle in the chambers of [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]. [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHeCap] should be feeling the Plaguelord's love even now. It is inevitable that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] will join us soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_1A;I'll bide my time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_CULTISTPLOT_1A;it seems [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is not quite ready for the gifts of Grandfather Nurgle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_1B;Let us give [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] one of Nurgle's gifts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_CULTISTPLOT_1B;This will help [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] see the joy one can receive from the Lord of Decay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_1C;The time has come to show [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] the glory of Father Nurgle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_2;Over the past few days you have been hearing voices and having strange dreams of plague victims cavorting in piles of filth, even as their flesh rots away. At first you questioned your own sanity, but this morning you awoke to find you had contracted a horrible disease!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_2A;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap], no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_3;Over the past few days you have been hearing voices and having strange dreams of plague victims cavorting in piles of filth, even as their flesh rots away. However, today you received an anonymous message: 'We can help you. Follow these directions and come alone...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_3A;No, never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_CULTISTPLOT_3A; As awful as this is, nothing good could happen by going to the sewers alone at night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_3B;Fine! Anything to stop these nightmares.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_4;You sent [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] an anonymous message to meet you alone in the sewers, but [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] never showed up. Perhaps [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] is not yet ready to embrace Nurgle. However, all come before the Maggot Lord eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_4A;All glory to Father Nurgle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_5;You sent [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] an anonymous message to meet you alone in the sewers, and [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] stands before you. [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] is covered in filth and looks half-mad, but they shall soon find solace in the arms of the Plaguefather.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_5A;Come now, dear friend, Papa Nurgle will make things right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_6;You follow the directions to the letter and go alone into some sewer, deep underground. You soon find yourself surrounded by hooded figures in filthy, decaying robes. The plague-ridden figures begin to chant words of power that you cannot resist...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_6A;Nurgle! Plaguefather! Lord of Decay! I shall serve you, just end my pain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_7;With the help of other acolytes and devotees of She Who Thirsts, you have succeeded in placing several artifacts of Slaanesh in the chambers of [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]. [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHeCap] should be experiencing the ecstasy of the Master of Excess even now. This pleasure will surely cause [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] to join us soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_7A;Let us invite [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] to a party where we can show them the joys of the Prince of Pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_7B;The time has come to show [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] the sensation of the Lord of Delights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_8;You have been invited to a feast, but you soon notice that this is no ordinary party. You see some of the other guests begin to overindulge in food and wine while others start performing lewd and licentious acts to themselves and others...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_8A;Time to leave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_8B;This is great, I'm staying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_9;You invited [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] to a party where you made sure that the mood would turn to more extreme activities. However, it turns out that [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] left early and didn't partake in the festivities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_9A;[Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHisCap] loss. I'll keep trying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_10;You invited [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] to a party where you made sure that the mood would turn to more carnal activities. Luckily [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] enjoyed [Root.PlotTarget.GetHimselfHerself], and will soon follow the ways of the Lord of Dark Delights!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_10A;The Master of Ecstasy will be pleased!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_11;Lately you have been haunted by unbearably pleasurable dreams where you engage in unspeakable acts with impossibly beautiful creatures with the features of both men and women. However, today you received an anonymous message: 'We can help you. Follow these directions and come alone...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_11A;No, never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_CULTISTPLOT_11A;Going to a brothel alone at night will only make things worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_11B;Maybe there's something to this message.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_CULTISTPLOT_11B;I could perhaps get some 'relief' at the brothel as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_12;You sent [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] an anonymous message to meet you alone in an isolated brothel, but [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] never showed up. Perhaps [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] is not yet ready to embrace Slaanesh. However, no one can resist the Prince of Pleasure forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_12A;Soon all will serve Slaanesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_13;You sent [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] an anonymous message to meet you alone in an isolated brothel, and now [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] stands before you. You can see [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] desire for more sensation in [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] eyes as you begin to instruct [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] in the ways of the Lord of Dark Delights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_13A;We welcome you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_14;You follow the instructions to the letter and go alone to a remote brothel. There you see people engaging in all manner of unspeakable acts. As they moan and cry out dark words power, you find yourself unable to resist the temptation the words bring...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_14A;Slaanesh! Prince of Chaos! Lord of Excess! I shall follow you into a world of endless sensations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_15;With the help of other acolytes and followers of the Changer of Ways, you have succeeded in placing several artifacts of Tzeentch in the chambers of [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]. [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHeCap] should be filled with the ambition of the Architect of Fate even now. [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] cannot escape change and will join us soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_15A;Let us send [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] this book describing the true state of things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_15B;The time has come to show [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] the splendour of the Master of Deceit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_16;A book without a title was pushed into my hands by a hooded man clad in midnight blue. Something was said, but was lost in the confusion. The book was still there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_16A;Hey... wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_16B;It wants me to read it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_16C;Burn it! It is clearly a heretical text.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_17;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] has the book in his possession, and your agents inform you that [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] has spent a great deal of time lately trying to decipher its secrets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_17A;Excellent! Soon, he will be ready to accept the ways of the Great Mutator.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_18;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] had the book in his possession, but your agents inform you that [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] has burned it without opening it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_18A;Only a fool would try escape the schemes of the Great Conspirator.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_19;Lately you have been haunted by maniacal dreams filled with riotous colours and creature beyond imagining, while your waking moments are filled with runaway daydreams and intricate plans. However, today you received an anonymous message: 'We can help you achieve your goals. Follow these directions and come alone...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_19A;No, never! Nothing comes for free, there is always catch...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_19B;If this person at the inn can help me, I would be stupid not to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_20;You sent [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] an anonymous message to meet you alone in an isolated inn, but [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] never showed up. Perhaps [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] is not yet ready to embrace Tzeentch. However, none can escape the Changer of Ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_20A;Soon all will serve Tzeentch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_21;You sent [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] an anonymous message to meet you alone in an isolated inn, and [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] stands before you. You speak to him of Tzeentch and the power that awaits, and soon enough, [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] gives in...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_21A;We welcome you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_22;You follow the instructions to the letter and go alone to a remote inn. There you find a group of hooded people, each wearing a different sinister mask. They begin whispering fell words of power and you know you need only take their potency for your own...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_22A;Tzeentch! Father of Lies! the Great Mutator! I shall devote myself to your ever-changing ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_23;With the help of other acolytes and fanatics of the Blood God, you have succeeded in placing several artifacts of Khorne in the chambers of [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]. [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHeCap] should be filled with the rage of Brass Lord even now. This blood-lust will no doubt cause [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] to join us soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_23A;Let us send [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] this weapon dedicated to the Lord of the Skull Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_23B;The time has come to show [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] the glory of Khorne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_24;A package arrived for you today that contained a masterfully crafted weapon. However, no matter how many times you clean it, you can't seem to remove the bloodstains the blade...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_24A;Bloodstains never injured anyone, it's the injury that makes the bloodstain. Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_24B;This is an ill omen. I don't care how fine a weapon it is, destroy it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_25;You delivered the weapon to [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName], and your agents inform you that [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] has grown quite fond of it, using it upon any who displease [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_25A;BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_26;You delivered the weapon to [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName], however your agents inform you that [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] destroyed soon after. HOW DARE THEY DENY KHORNE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_26;BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_27;Lately you have been haunted by dreams of endless slaughter. In them you crush your enemies and see them driven before you. You awake as you hear the lamentations of their women. However, today you received an anonymous message: 'We can help you. Follow these directions and come alone...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_27A;No, never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_CULTISTPLOT_27A;What good could come of going to fighting pit alone at night?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_27B;Sounds Fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_CULTISTPLOT_27B;Maybe I can even bash some heads too...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_28;You sent [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] an anonymous message to meet you alone in an isolated fighting pit, but [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] never showed up. Perhaps [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] is not yet ready to shed blood for Khorne. However, all will shed blood for the Blood God before long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_28A;BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_29;You sent [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] an anonymous message to meet you alone in an isolated fighting pit, and [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] stands before you. You see the bloodlust in [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] eyes and tell [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] to take [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] fill...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_29A;BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_30;You follow the instructions to the letter and go alone to a remote fighting pit. There a person cloaked in red tells you to take your fill killing the captives you see around you. Their screams are the sweetest sound you ever heard...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_30A;BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_31;With the help of various backers - both witting and unwitting - you are now in a position to bring the gifts of the Plaguefather to [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s homelands. Grandfather Nurgle will be pleased!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_31A;All should share in the gifts of the Plague Lord;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_32;An outbreak of a strange and virulent disease has occurred in one of your provinces. The unnatural spread of it suggests this is the work of cultists devoted to the Ruinous Powers! All you can do now is try to contain the outbreak and redouble your efforts to root out cultists in your midst!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_32A;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] save us from these plagues!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_33;With the help of various backers - both witting and unwitting - you are now in a position to incite a tribe of feral beastmen to ravage [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s homelands. Khorne will be pleased by the strife this causes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_33A;BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_34;Your marshal informs you that a tribe of beastmen has suddenly arrived and started attacking your holdings, raiding villages and burning homesteads. The sudden nature of this suggests that they were guided there by cultists devoted to the Ruinous Powers! Worse still, the peasants are blaming you for the lack of protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_34A;From the fury of the beastmen, [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap], deliver us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_35;With the help of various backers - both witting and unwitting - you are now in a position to taint the food and water supplies in [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s land with Warpdust, which will lead to an increase in horrific mutations. Tzeentch will be pleased!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_35A;Glory to the Great Mutator!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_36;Your steward tells you that traces of Warpdust have been found to be poisoning your land. Evidence suggests this is the work of cultists devoted to the Ruinous Powers! We will likely see an increased number of mutations, perhaps even in your own court, until the Warpdust dissipates!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_36A;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] protect us from the gaze of the Dark Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_37;With the help of various backers - both witting and unwitting - you are now in a position to subvert [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s lands with carefully prepared intoxicants and public agitators. Slaanesh will be pleased!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_37A;Glory to the Prince of Pleasure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_38;Your steward informs you that a sudden rash of riots, bizarre festivals and even spontaneous public orgies have struck a particular region. The peasants seem to drink, whore, and gamble away all their income, and even some of the better bred citizens do the same. It is suspected that it is no mere passing craze, but a deliberate attempt by servants of the Dark Gods to weaken your rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_38A;But... they'll still pay taxes, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_0;Witch Hunters are a necessary evil - though their methods can be cruel, they are often the first and last line of defence against the spread of Chaos. As the holder of a major religious site, you have several Witch Hunters in your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_20A;I... ehh, heresy? No no, let me explain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_21;The courtier had a good explanation. They seems to be telling the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_21A;Fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_21B;A good cultist is a good liar! This is proof of guilt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_22;The courtier did not had a good explanation. You must inform the liege of this heretic in our midst!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_22B;At once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_23;The Witch Hunter is accusing you of crimes most foul, a sure death sentence if they get their way. What do you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_23A;Banish him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_23B;Imprison him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_23C;Appeal to my liege!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_24;My liege, the Witch Hunter has accused me of heresy. These charges are completely baseless, I implore you to intervene on my behalf and clear my good name! In the name of all that is holy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_24A;All heretics must die by fire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_24B;I'm sure you are not a heretic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_24C;To the dungeons with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_25;Your liege sides with your accuser. The Witch Hunter has already won the loyalty of your personal guards, who seize you and drag you to the court yard where a great pyre is being prepared for your execution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_25A;Nooooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_26;Your liege sides with the Witch Hunter. Your own guards seize you, and drag you to the dungeons. At least your liege was merciful, and did not condemn you to purification by fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_26A;Nooooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_27;Your liege intervenes, and the Witch Hunter - grudgingly - backs off. You will not suffer death by fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_27A;A close call!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_28;You receive word from one of the more 'militant' sects of your faith. They'd like you to host a Witch Hunter for a while, so as to curtail any potential heresy in your land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_28A;Sure... why not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_28B;No! Witch Hunters cause trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_29;This noble of your realm has been burned alive by the Witch Hunters, on suspicion of heretical activities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_29A;I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_29B;Do not bother me with such news again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_30;There are known vampires in the realm... these must be rooted out with fire, stakes, silver and faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_30A;I must inform my liege at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_31;My liege, there are known vampires infesting your realm! These must be hunted down at once. Will you give the order to cleanse the land of this foul taint?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_31A;Yes, of course - get to work at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_32B;No, leave them alone...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_33;Your liege has ordered that open vampires in the realm be exterminated - fanatical peasant armies led by Witch Hunters approach with fire and silver blades, but due to your skills you manage to escape them alive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_33A;My lands... lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_34;Your top liege has ordered that open vampires in the realm be exterminated, and fanatical peasants led by Witch Hunters approach with fire and silver blades. You try to run, but they manage to corner you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_34A;No, not like this - I was promised eternal life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_35;Witch Hunters are a necessary evil - though their methods can be cruel, they are often the first and last line of defence against the spread of Chaos. Since there are no Witch Hunters in your realm, do you want to invite some?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_35A;Yes, immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_35B;No, Witch Hunters are troublesome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#namespace = BRETONNIA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.0;You are the ruler of a Bretonnian castle, and you - like the rest of your fellow rulers - are an ordained Knight of the Realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.1;You are a skilled warrior, and it is time you took up your duties to the realm and became a Knight Errant of Bretonnia. It is your duty to seek out dangerous threats and conquer them in the name of the Lady.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.10.b;No, a mere mob of orcs is an unworthy foe!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.10;You hear rumours that an orc warband is raiding this area. Do you want to investigate?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.11.a;I hope there's enough for all of us! Onward to glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.11.b; No, wait. I think I see a giant over there, this way men!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.11;After some hard riding you find the trail of destruction left behind and quickly catch up to the orcs. The greenskins seem to be meandering across the countryside, looting and burning at random according to the whims of a larger-looking boss. It's only a small war party of less than two-score orcs with a mob of lesser attendant greenskins, but your band of faithful are but a handful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.12.a;For the Lady! Charge!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.12;The orcs are too unprepared to do more than turn and roar defiance as your band approaches, and you smash into them with your fellow knights in a glorious charge. With lance and sword you drive a deep wedge into their hastily formed ranks. The orcs fight poorly and the boss only slightly more challenging, your lance taking it in the throat before you crush it into the mud. The assorted goblins and snotlings that were following the mob attempt to scatter, with most of them ridden down with ease. It is a righteous slaughter, and their kind will now know the folly of trespassing in these lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.13.a;Men, advance backwards! Double quick!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.13;As soon as you begin to charge the orcs, the boss in control of the mob spots you, shouting and beating his underlings into crude ranks to take the impact. Some of them brace with great shields and pikes, and as your charge is broken you find yourself being attacked from all directions!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.14;As you travel along the coast you spot a sleek black ship moored in the shallow water. On the beach nearby is a dark elf raiding party, and they have captured a number of humans! Surely taken in lightning-quick raids on nearby farms and villages, they are preparing them for transport back to their terrible slave-markets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.15;Your mighty charge takes the foul slavers completely by surprise, and rather than form a line and try to repel you, they make a mad dash for their ships. You slay many of the cowardly elves, and free the captives. The surviving raiders make it back to their vessel and flee, but after taking such losses and failing to carry cargo they are unlikely to return any time soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.16.a;Arghh, men *cough* advance... backwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.16.b;A true knight never turns from danger!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.16;The dark elves have sharp eyes that saw you coming from afar, and quickly form disciplined ranks with tall shields and cruel-looking blades at the ready. Worse still, as you approach the taste of foul magic suffuses the air. An unnaturally pale, lithe sorceress pushes her way to the front of the line, leering at you while performing an arcane ritual, and suddenly the air around you explodes with thunder! When you come to a moment later you realise you've been thrown from your horse and are smoking slightly!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.17.a;Forwards! To victory! For the Lady!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.17;A surge of righteous anger fills you and you leap back up on your horse, spit the blood from your mouth, couch your lance, and with a great battle cry you charge the foul sorceress and her cohorts!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.18;The Sorceress casts another spell at you, but as her lightning bolt fails to stop you, she turns and runs and the rest follow. You slaughter many of them as they flee for their ship, and free the captives.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.19;You rush the dark elves, but the sorceress merely grins wickedly and hurls another spell at you. Lightning arcs out from her hands once more and strikes you, and you feel excruciating pain as you are once again blasted from your horse. This battle is over!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.2;You are a knight of Bretonnia, it is only fitting that you travel the land doing great deeds, rescuing maidens and slaying monsters. Will you take up the questing life?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.20.a;I return home to heal - For the Lady!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.20;You have become wounded, and can no longer carry on the questing life. It is time to return to your castle and regain your strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.21;You are a knight of Bretonnia, but only the most noble and pure knights are worthy to sip from the Holy Grail of the Lady of the Lake. Do you want to test yourself on this great - but also dangerous, quest?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.22.b;Simple peasants - so that's where my tax money went!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.22;You come across a remote shrine, dedicated to a sighting of the Lady many years ago. Naturally you leave an offering to help maintain the shrine, but as you prepare to leave a local headman boldly asks you for a further donation to the help feed the local village.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.23.b;I'm all alone, no one will know if I just ride away...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.23;You know you are not the bravest of knights, but you do try your best. On a solitary ride through the countryside you come across one of your men-at-arms, his weapon sundered, his shield split and his chest carved open. He manages to gasp out an account between fits of coughing, and before he passes you eventually discern that a Norscan berserker had wandered out of the wilderness, raving and cursing in a crude language and slaughtering anyone he sees. He has already slain twenty good men single-handedly, and judging by the screams just over the hill, he's not far off...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.24.a;Away with that, temptress! Just water for me from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.24.b;I could indulge myself just once more...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.24;You are not the purest or most abstinent of knights, so life is a daily challenge to meet the lofty ideals you hold. One night you and your retinue arrive in a decent tavern to rest after your latest efforts, and soon after you take a seat a barmaid arrives to serve. Tired and deprived, you feel especially appreciative at the sight of the pitcher of wine balanced on her hip, and her warm inviting smile...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.25.a;*restrain yourself* Be on your way, peasant...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.25.b;I'll horsewhip you from here to Cathay, you foul peasant!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.25;While passing through the countryside, you proceed past a filthy family of mud-scrabbling peasants. They drop their loads and fall to the ground with eyes averted as you pass by, but you can hardly believe it when one particularly malodorous one looks you directly in the eye!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.26.a;Well met, Sir Knight! I am ready for the challenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.26;You can't believe it... one day while riding in the woods, the Green Knight appears. This is the final test! If you prove worthy and defeat him, the Lady of the Lake will appear and allow you to sip from the Holy Grail!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.27;It... it's finally happening! The Lady of the Lake appears before you, her grace and beauty beyond compare. Purified from your trials she allows you to sip from the Grail, and you feel vitality and strength flow into you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.3;You have become maimed, and can no longer carry on the questing life. It is time to return to your castle, and focus on strengthening your own lands with the rest of your strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.30.c;I care nothing for what my vassals think!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.31.a;Yes, I rule with the Lady's Blessing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia31B;No, but I will continue questing for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.31.c;I care nothing for what my vassals think!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.31;Seven years have passed - have you become a Grail Knight?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.32;Rumours reach you that the new ruler of Bretonnia has succeeded in the Grail Quest, and now rules with the blessing of the Lady of the Lake.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.33;Rumours reach you that the new ruler of Bretonnia has failed in his Grail Quest, but has decided to rule on without the blessing of the Lady of the Lake. This is almost certain to start a civil war in that realm...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.34;Rumours reach you that the new ruler of Bretonnia is having difficulty completing his grail quest, but is still determined to quest on until he succeeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.4;You have quested for a long time now, perhaps it is time to return home and see to your responsibilities there?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.6.b;No, I seek greater glories than mere trolls!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.6;While searching for local challenges, you come across an unusual story. Sheep and peasants have gone missing, and despite repeated punishments the shepherds insist they are not lacking in their duties. They claim a foul beast, as tall as a house and reeking like a tannery lurks in the hills, periodically emerging to devour whatever it can catch. After some conference with your retainers you determine it could very well be a troll! Do you want to investigate?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.7.b;No, wait... what if there is a dragon over there instead?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.7;After a week of searching, you finally come upon some troll tracks which lead to a dark cave which emanates horrendous smells and sounds. It seems there are more than one after all. Girding yourself as best as you are able, you light some torches and prepare to destroy this threat to the local community.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.8.a;I dedicate this victory to the Lady!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.8;Your band marches into the troll lair, and though they are strong and ferocious opponents they are no match for your superior knightly valour. Swords cut them to pieces, torches and oil cauterise their wounds, and faith wreathes you like an unbreakable barrier. After slaying half a dozen of them, you take a moment to rest and examine the lair. Though trolls are usually far too stupid to gather treasure and are more likely to simply eat it, for whatever reason these ones had a small pile of loot. Perhaps it was dessert?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.9.a;Men, advance in the other direction - quickly!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.9;Your band marches into the troll lair, full of pride and zeal, but quickly find yourselves in trouble! Six trolls loom out of the darkness like living nightmares, snatching your retainers up into their maws and ignoring the few wounds you manage to inflict. You are hard pressed to make it back to the exit alive!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia35desc;It... it's finally happening! The Lady of the Lake appears before you, her grace and beauty beyond compare. She let's you sip from the grail, but it is not the invigorating and life changing experience you had heard it would be. But, surely you feel... something?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia35A;I... I think I feel a little more holy now?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia35B;It was the true holy grail, it must have been!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia35C;No, this isn't right. I must continue questing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia36desc;There have been some doubts cast on your vision of the Lady and the Holy Grail. You do not have the aura that other grail knights have, nor did the Green Knight appear to challenge you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia36A;They weren't there - it happened! Maybe the Grail is simply different for each man?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia37desc;Rumours reach you that the new ruler of Bretonnia has supposedly completed his grail quest, but there are doubts as to whether or not it was the real Grail. This will make his rule a troubled one, no doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#NAMEPSACE = CARSTEIN;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCARSTEIN.0.b;No, I'll attack somewhere else.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.0;For too long, you have bided your time. Now your great spell is complete, and you have raised an army of undead to take on what's left of the Empire. Let the blood flow, and let those who will not serve you in life - serve you in death!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.1;Rumours reach you that in Sylvania a vampire lord by the name of Vlad von Carstein has summoned a massive army of undead, and aims to make war on the fragmented empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.10;With the death of Vlad von Carstein, the undead armies he had raised return to the ground, undead no more... there may be hope for the Empire yet!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCARSTEIN.11.b;No, I'll decide my own path of expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.11;Your empire and armies keep growing, and you are ready to move against Nordland, securing that flank against any counter-attack. You raise more undead for your armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCARSTEIN.12.b;No, I'll decide my own path of expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.12;Your empire and armies keep growing, and you are ready to move against Westerland, in preparation for the final assault against Altdorf. You raise more undead for your armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.2;Rumours reach you that in the distant land of Sylvania, a powerful vampire by the name of Vlad von Carstein has summoned a massive army of undead, and makes war on the fragmented empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCARSTEIN.3.b;No, I'll decide my own path of expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.3;You have conquered Ostermark. Now you should move west, towards the imperial capitals and cripple the Empire while it is still divided! You raise more undead for your armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCARSTEIN.4.b;No, I'll decide my own path of expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.4;You have conquered large parts of the empire - now it is time to move further into Hochland, destroying the weaker foes before moving west against the major seats of imperial power. You raise more undead for your armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCARSTEIN.5.b;No, I'll decide my own path of expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.5;Your empire has grown to a great size now, and you are ready to move towards Middenland, heading for the ancient Imperial capital of Middenheim itself. You raise more undead for your armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCARSTEIN.6.b;No, I'll decide my own path of expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.6;Your empire and armies keep growing, and you are ready to move northwards, securing that flank against any counter-attack. You raise more undead for your armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.7;Vile treachery - you awaken from your coffin one evening, and find your precious ring stolen! You are now no longer able to return from death over and over again, and you may have to slow the rate of your expansion so as to not risk your life...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.8;Rumours reach your realm that the mighty von Carstein ring which made this tyrant unkillable has been stolen, and he has not managed to retrieve it... there is hope now, that he can be stopped.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.9;With the final death of Vlad von Carstein, the undead armies he had raised return to the ground, undead no more... This is a terrible blow, let's hope we can hold the realm together without them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTCARSTEIN.13;Risen again!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCARSTEIN.13;With the power of the von Carstein ring, you are able to return to life despite wounds that would destroy other vampires. This is a painful process, but one your enemies have no counter to!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#NAMESPACE = CHAOS;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCHAOS.0;The Everchosen is the champion of all the Chaos gods. You can journey to the Altar of Ultimate Darkness in distant Naggaroth to seek the favour of the Chaos Gods. The stronger the Winds of Chaos are, the more likely they are to give you their mark.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.1.a;I wonder how strong the Winds of Chaos are...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.1;You make your way across the wastes, into the northern limits of Naggaroth, where stories tell of the Altar of Ultimate Darkness. Finally, after many trials, you reach your destination...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.10.a;Yes, I will march alongside the Everchosen!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.10.b;No, I will never march with that fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.10;An Everchosen has been selected, and a great war is being prepared. Daemons of the Dark Gods march under their banner - surely you yourself should also march to war alongside this new champion?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.2.a;Yes, I will face their terror even so!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.2.b;No, perhaps now is not the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.2;The Winds of Chaos are weak at the moment, and the Ruinous Powers are unlikely to grant you their blessing. Do you still wish to proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.3.a;Yes, I will face their terror even so!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.3.b;No, perhaps now is not the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.3;The Winds of Chaos are only moderately strong at the moment, and the Ruinous Powers are less likely to grant you their blessing. Do you still wish to proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.4.b;No, perhaps now is not the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.4;The Winds of Chaos are  strong at the moment, and the Ruinous Powers are likely to grant you their blessing. Do you wish to proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.5.b;No, perhaps now is not the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.5;The Winds of Chaos are very strong at the moment, and the Ruinous Powers are almost certain to grant you their blessing if you pass their trials. Do you wish to proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.6.a;I will prove myself worthy - charge!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.6;Upon entering the temple you are beset by nightmarish visions, testing your faith to its very core. Your mind is strong enough to persevere, and finally you come to the test... you must defeat the Champion of the Gods to receive their mark!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.7.a;Urrrghh! No... not ... like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.7;Upon entering the temple you are beset by nightmarish visions, and attacked by daemons of all sorts! You cannot hold on, the Gods are displeased at your trespass, and soon you are surrounded fighting desperately for your life!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.8;You have won the duel against the champion, and you finally kneel before the Altar of Ultimate Darkness, and receive the mark of the Dark Gods. 'Rise... Everchosen... and conquer in our name' a terrible unison of four voices growls in your head...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.9.a;Let all bow before the Everchosen!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.9;You return to your lands, bearing the mark of the Gods. Across the wastes, word spreads like wildfire: An Everchosen has been selected, and armies of daemons march by [From.GetHerHis] side! They would be fools not to join you now in the coming war...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDARKELF.0.b;I could have done just as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.0;While on a border patrol, a servant won a great victory against a pack of marauding fiends. [From.GetSheHeCap] cut into their ranks, and put dozens of them to the sword. [From.GetSheHeCap] is truly blessed by the gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.1.b;Imprison [From.GetHerHim]! I'll torture [From.GetHerHim] myself later...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.1;While on a border patrol, a servant's warband was ambushed, but [From.GetSheHe] fled and left [From.GetHerHis] men to die! [From.GetSheHeCap] name is in disgrace, and [From.GetSheHe] has surely angered the gods with [From.GetHerHis] cowardice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.10.a;Yes, time to go home and put this wealth to good use.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.10.b;Yes, time to go home and put this wealth to good use.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.10;You have raided for a long time now and amassed great wealth. Perhaps it is time to stop, before your luck runs out?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.12.a;Inform the crew - we bathe in blood tonight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.12.b;Inform the crew - we bathe in blood tonight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.12;Off the coast of the Old World one night you spot lights ahead; it seems to be a small village. Do you want to go in and and pillage it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.13;You silently sail up to the village, and then stealthily slip your warriors around it before unleashing a great war cry - the slaughter is glorious, and you take many slaves as captives!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.14;You get your warband ashore, but as soon as you approach the village an alarm goes off, and worse still the militia are reinforced by a contingent of patrolling knights! Curses - this village is too heavily defended!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.15;You come across a merchant convoy of human ships. There are three of them, but it looks like they are not warships. Prepare to board them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.15.a;Corsairs - full sail! Prepare for boarding action!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.15.b;No, attacking three ships is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.16.a;Bolt throwers, prepare to cut down their masts!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.16.b;Damnation. Three on one, hardly favourable. Time to withdraw.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.16;Spotting your sail, the ships turn towards you - brave fools, are they are actually going to try and fight you?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.17.a;And they had a rich cargo too!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.17;Your bolt throwers expertly disable the sails of two of the ships, leaving them dead in the water. Your crew board the other ship, and one by one, the others fall to. The sailors are cut down when they resist, with a choice selection of slaves picked from the 'lucky' survivors. This is a great victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.18.a;Turn about, we'll outsail these scows!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.18;Your bolt throwers failed to disable the approaching ships, and one of them carries a catapult which sends its own missiles your way. If one of them hits, it could be the end of you...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.19.a;Prepare to repel boarders - bolt throwers, fire at will!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.19;Curses! An Eagle Ship from Ulthuan has spotted your sail, and is fast approaching. You can't outrun the warship sent by your vile cousins, you'll have to try to repel their attack...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.2;Your liege's court is crowded, and it's time to thin the herd. By getting rid of your competitors, your own favour in the eyes of your liege can only increase...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.21.a;We claim their ship, it will fetch a good price.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.21;Your cousins catch up to you but you managed to disable their bolt thrower with your own counter-strikes. A fierce boarding action ensues, but the hatred and ferocity of your crew overcomes the attempt, and soon the high elves are all dead, or fated for much worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.22;A deadly shooting match ensues, you manage to do serious damage to their sails, but your own ship has been battered as well. It's time to attempt one last shot at their main mast, otherwise it looks like you won't be able to flee...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.23;You have become wounded, and can no longer carry on the raiding life. It is time to return to your home and regain your strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDRUCHIFEAST.18;The food is spectacular... slow roasted human hearts, exquisite wine from Tilean orchards, and a lavish display of all other food types plundered from around the known world. Delicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDRUCHIFEAST.23.a;I have made a new ally tonight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDRUCHIFEAST.23;Late at night, you speak to one of your guests and find that this is an amazing individual. You talk late into the night, plotting together and coming up with ways to achieve both your goals...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDRUCHIFEAST.24.a;I have made a new ally tonight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDRUCHIFEAST.3;A beastmaster and his retinue arrive, offering to entertain your guests with glorious slaughter as his beasts are pitted against slaves, courtiers you dislike, or other beasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDRUCHIFEAST.31;The pit fighters you hire put on a spectacular show, defeating both slaves and beasts put against them, and blood flows for the glory of Khaine!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDRUCHIFEAST.32;The pit fighters your liege hired for the feast put on a spectacular show - never have you seen such skill in the pits, they cut through both slaves and beasts like true professionals!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
