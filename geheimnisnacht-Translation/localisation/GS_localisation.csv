CHOSENDUEL;Chosen Duel;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHOSEN.1;The gods have heard your plea, and have answered. Following the instructions delivered in the entrails of your servant, you find yourself in a twisted grove of otherworldly trees. A hulking beast of malformed flesh and bone claws its way through to the clearing and roars a challenge to you. You're not sure if it's a former champion who succumbed to their corruption, or some unfortunate beast that was twisted by the gods, but it's definitely hostile. Defeat the creature, and gain your infamy!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHOSEN.1.a;Charge! For the Dark Gods!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHOSEN.1.b;Perhaps I will come back later?;;;;;;;;;x
VICTORY;Victory!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHOSEN.2;The beast is huge and possesses immense strength, but is slow and witless. It is a simple matter to dodge the clumsy blows and strike it repeatedly as it bellows and lurches at you. Finally, after countless strikes, the creature lets out a forlorn cry and collapses in a pool of its own blood. You emerge victorious, and thus may be granted your gift from the gods...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHOSEN.2.a;I am the greatest!;;;;;;;;;x
FAILURE;Failure!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHOSEN.3;You thought you had won, but your smugness turns to horror when the monster's fury increases and catches you off guard in a careless moment. Now, you lie in a pool of blood, becoming a meal, not a Chosen.;;;;;;;;;x

DONEQUESTING;Quest Finished;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHOSEN.4;After returning home from your victory, word has spread of your deed, now a band of hopeful warriors has arrived at your hold, pledging service to you as their rightful leader. They expect you to lead them to greater glories and triumphs.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAnorscan.7;Alas, it is as the gods demand it.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCnorscan.8;Unlike the southerners, Northern realms barely recognize the heredity concepts of the south, and as such, unless the heir is clearly favored by their gods, the realm will dissolve on the leaders death. Your heir currently does not show any favor at all, and unless they were to improve, your realm will dissolve upon your death.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAnorscan.8.a;I must shape them up before I die...;;;;;;;;;x
