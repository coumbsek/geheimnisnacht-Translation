SJDwarfevents.30.desc;Your plan was a success! The falling boulders crushed [From.GetName], killing [From.GetHerHim] instantly.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.30.option1;I am so good at intrigue;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.31.desc;You have put your masonry skills to the test and started building a completely new mining system in one of your provinces and it ended up very successfully.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.31.option1;Excellent;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.32.desc;You are now a masterful mason! There are few limits to what you can and cannot build and other Dwarfs often look upon you with envy in their eyes.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.32.option1;Sounds exciting!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.33.desc;You have lately been working on improving your throne room's engravings and you can't stop yourself from being very pleased with the result.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.33.option1;A wonderful throne room made by a wonderful [Root.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

SJDwarfevents.35.option2;This was a one time thing;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.36.desc;The Human beer served to you was nowhere near the taste of Dwarf beer, almost making you vomit. You feel a big urge to tell them exactly what you feel about their so called beer!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.36.option1;Are you trying to poison me, manling!?;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.36.option2;I guess I better get used to the taste...;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

SJDwarfevents.37.option3;I should have bought some Dwarf beer before I invited [From.GetHerHim] over;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.38.desc;[From.GetName] got very angry when I voiced my opinion about the awful Human beer served and [From.GetSheHe] dismissed me with all of the needed courtesy.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.38.option1;Hah, weak Manlings!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.39.desc;When you voiced your opinion on the coloured water that the Humans call beer [From.GetSheHe] gave you some Dwarf beer instead. The conversation continued on smoothly with the help of a beer or two...;;;;;;;;;;x;;;
SJDwarfevents.39.option1;Nothing can beat Dwarf beer!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.40.desc;Is it the Manlings who keep the Orcs at bay? Are the Elflings famous for their engineering? No, it is the Dwarfs and only Dwarfs who can do that and we should be proud of that!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.40.option1;We are glorious!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.40.option2;Pride goes before fall;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.42.desc;"An ordinary part in a ""regular"" Dwarf's life is the regular visit to the local tavern to both drink the excellent beer served but to also spend some time with friends. But you are no ""regular"" Dwarf right?";;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.42.option1;I should not let my responsibilities weigh me down!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.42.option2;I think I will skip this time;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SJDwarfevents.42.option3;I don't have any time for that. Because I got work to do!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.43.desc;The first things that enter your mind when you walk through the door into the cosy little tavern are the constant laughters and the singing from a dozen drunken Dwarfs on the right side of the tavern. To the left a couple of human merchants sit, trying out the Dwarf beer for the first time with several loud exclamations in their foreign tongue. Most other seats have already been taken by the Dwarf miners who just ended their mining shift and are now eager to have a drink, except for the seats far in the corner to the left who are almost completely covered in shadows. You take some fast steps forward but slow down when you realise that you don't know where to sit.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.43.option1;I will sit by myself;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.43.option2;I have always wanted to know humans better;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.43.option3;I will go and join the singing Dwarfs at their table;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.44.desc;"Suddenly a longbearded Dwarf with several large scars enters the tavern. He scans the room with his watchul eyes before he starts to walk towards your table. ""May I join?"" he asks.";;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.44.option1;Sure;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.44.option2;Come up with some plausible excuse for saying no;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.45.desc;The veteran tells you some of the most fascinating stories of his adventures. But he also says that he has grown tired of adventuring and wants to settle down. Maybe you could offer him that?;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.45.option1;Welcome!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.45.option2;I don't think that would be a good idea;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.46.desc;When you sit by yourself and have nothing to do except for drinking, it is quite hard to resist drinking. Dwarfs can drink a lot without even flinching but there is a limit...;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.46.option1;Who can resist proper Dwarf beer!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.46.option2;I am a Dwarf, not a drunkard!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.47.desc;Suddenly one of your courtiers appears and sits down at your table. You talk to each other till sunrise even though you barely manage to not fall asleep. Will you contact the courtier again?;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.47.option2;It was a one time thing;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.47.option1;We should do that again, my friend!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.48.desc;It doesn't take long for the human traders to try to sell you something. In this case it is a book which they claim comes from one of the lost Dwarf holds.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.48.option1;I will buy it;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.48.option2;It is obviously a fraud;;;;;;;;;;x;;;
SJDwarfevents.49.desc;The book you bought has now been confirmed to be a real one, coming from a hold which must have been destroyed such a long time ago so that no one even knows it's name.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.49.option1;And it contains some very interesting knowledge;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.50.desc;The book you bought is a Dwarf book but instead of containing lost knowledge it is a badly written romantic fiction.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.50.option1;Those humans will pay!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.51.desc;The humans tells you the most fascinating stories about their homeland, giving you a further understanding about how the world is outside your hold. Because that was the truth wasn't it?;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.51.option1;Very interesting;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.52.desc;The humans are the representatives of a rich merchant who wants to set up trade with one of the Dwarf holds on a large scale.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.52.option1;I think we can come up with something profitable for both of us!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.53.desc;It seems like the humans were not merchants but instead debt collectors wanting to get their debt paid. You talked to them for a while before excusing yourself.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
SJDwarfevents.53.option1;I wonder where they are going;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.54.desc;The Dwarfs were an active bunch singing and drinking without any end in sight.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.54.option1;We are having a great time!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.55.desc;You easily take part in their festivities with a wide smile on your face and you think that you have become friends with one of them.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.55.option1;I will never forget this day;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.56.desc;The drunken Dwarfs have challenged you to a drinking competition, will you accept or not?;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.56.option1;Of course I will accept it!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.56.option2;No, I got to work tomorrow;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.57.desc;You easily out-drink your opponent and claim the price!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.57.option1;Beer! *belch* I LOVE BEEEEEER!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.58.desc;Your opponent drinks five flagons in a matter of seconds even though he must have drunk several flagons already.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

SJDwarfevents.59.desc;The night at the tavern is finally over so you slowly drag yourself home awaiting the terrible hangover that will soon hit you with the force of a bull.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;

SJDwarfevents.62.option2;The Dwarf warriors!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.62.option3;The handgun-armed Thunderers!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.62.option4;Fighting?! Sounds dangerous...;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.63a.desc;The quarrellers are powerful missile troops that use their crossbows to kill the enemy at range. The bolts that the crossbow fires may not have the armour penetration of the handguns but they have a superior range instead which can prove many times even more deadly than the handguns. Fighting in a disciplined manner,firing volley after volley with the high precision that the crossbow is so famous for and so they are righteously feared by their enemies and awed by their allies. You are their lord but they will still not allow you to join their ranks if they consider you unworthy. The training is mostly ceremonial as most Dwarfs that join the quarrellers already know how to use a crossbow but that does not make it any less important to not fail.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.63b.desc;The Dwarf warriors are the bulk of the Dwarf military might, locked in a hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Fighting in their famous shieldwall formations, these fierce opponents are close to unstoppable if they manage to keep their formation intact. Every Dwarf warrior uses their own personal armour but most Dwarfs still fight with an axe and shield, and wear a chainmail as well. You are their lord but they will still not allow you to join their ranks if they consider you unworthy. The training is mostly ceremonial as most Dwarfs that join the Dwarf warriors already know how to use an axe but that does not make it any less important to not fail.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.63c.desc;The thunderers use handguns to kill the enemy with great effect. The bullets can penetrate nearly every set of armour killing a charging chaos warrior in an instant. The thunderers shoot in methodical volleys with the screams of their enemies as a direct result of that. You are their lord but they will still not allow you to join their ranks if they consider you unworthy. The training is mostly ceremonial as most Dwarfs that join the thunderers already know how to use a handgun but that does not make it any less important to not fail.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.63.option1;Should I be worried?;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
SJDwarfevents.64a.desc;You manage to hit the target in most of your shots and you feel that your initial worry of failing was probably unnecessary.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.64b.desc;Each and every swing you make with your axe feels so natural, making you believe that your initial worry of getting failed was probably unnecessary.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.64.option1;What a relief...;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.65.desc;You are utterly hopeless with your weapon and the overseer of the test has at several times sneered at you when he passed by. You won't succeed and you know it.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.65.option1;I can always hope... right?;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.66a.desc;The final test went very well so you can now call yourself a quarreller!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.66b.desc;The final test went very well so you can now call yourself a Dwarf warrior!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.66c.desc;The final test went very well so you can now call yourself a thunderer!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.66.option1;Well done!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.67.desc;You failed the final test miserably and you leave the training field in shame.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.67.option1;I am not worthy of calling myself a Dwarf!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.68.desc;You are of such a great age so that you can now join the veteran regiments on the battlefield. Few Dwarfs get this honour and you can count yourself lucky to be one of them.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.68.option1;I will join the longbeards!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.68.option2;I will join the ironbreakers!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.69.desc;[Liege.GetTitledName] has bestowed the great honour of being in his hammerer bodyguard to you. Only the best and most seasoned warriors may serve in this elite bodyguard.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.69.option1;I accept, my liege;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.70a.desc;Your head is not clear enough to serve in the hammerer bodyguard anymore. It may be a wise idea to leave your place vacant so that someone else may join the hammerers instead.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.70b.desc;Due to your injury you are sadly not able to stay in the hammerer bodyguard anymore.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
SJDwarfevents.70c.desc;Because of the fact that your liege has thrown you into jail you are not allowed to be in the hammerer bodyguard anymore.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
