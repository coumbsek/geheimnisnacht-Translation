lahmian_elite_agent_desc;Elite Sisterhood agents are those most skilled and trusted by the Queen. They are sent on the most dangerous and difficult missions, but they are also a part of the inner circle of the sisterhood - so many Lahmians dream of attaining this coveted title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmian_protector;Lahmian Protector;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmian_protector_desc;Lahmian Protectors are charged with defending the Sisterhoods interests, by deadly force if necessary. Whereas other Lahmians will flee rather than engage in direct battle and give away the presence of the sisterhood, the protectors will stand and fight. Protectors are often human males skilled in the art of war and personal combat, but it is not unheard of for the Queen to give this title to a particularly warlike Lahmian either. Vampire protectors are, after all, likely to be better fighters than mere mortals due to their natural advantages in speed and strength. Some protectors even receive magical weapons and artifacts from the Queen so that they may fight better in the inevitable conflicts with the witch hunters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

witch_hunter;Witch Hunter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
witch_hunter_desc;Agents of the temples charged with rooting out heresy, Witch Hunters can be found all over the old world where rulers of the benign faiths still hold power.

khemri_tomb_king;Nehekhara Tomb King;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
khemri_tomb_king_desc;The Tomb Kings of Nehekhara are all that remain of the glories of an ancient, proud civilisation. Once believing they would wake up from embalmed death and live in a paradise where they would rule eternally, they instead woke up to horrible undeath and a cursed existence. Seeing their lands come to ruin, many have gone mad, while others are still driven by the ancient impulses to rule and expand their once-great empire. Their courts are a mockery of life, with food being served that cannot be tasted, wine being poured that cannot be drunk, but the great wealth and splendor remains - even if it is a decaying and hollow echo of what once was in the mighty land of Nehekhara.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
malekith;Malekith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
malekith_desc;Also known as "The Witch King", Malekith is the son of the great Aenarion and his second wife, Morathi. He was meant to inherit the Kingdom of Ulthuan after his father, but the princes chose Bel Shanaar instead, citing that they needed someone to rebuild rather than lead in wars. For a time Malekith accepted this, but eventually he could wait no longer, and he brought civil war and ruin to Ulthuan. Horribly scarred as the Flame of Asuryan rejected him as Phoenix King, he lives encased in a great suit of armour, always plotting to regain his birthright - the Phoenix Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

gryphon_mount;Griffon Mount;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gryphon_mount_desc;A Griffon is a powerful ally in battle, with the head of an eagle and the body of a lion.

wyvern_mount;Wyvern Mount;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wyvern_mount_desc;Typically used by powerful Greenskin generals, Wyverns - though not as powerful as dragons - are formidable adversaries and fierce fighters. They have a poison stinger which they use to great effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_mine_6_desc;Deep in the depths of the earth, Gromnil can be found. Easy to forge, yet nigh unbreakable once crafted, it is the most rare and valuable metal in the world.

ca_dwarfhold_1_desc;Dwarf holds are typically near-impregnable, being fortified both above ground and underground and crafted by the most skilled stone masons of the known world.

creature_amazon;Amazon;;;;;;;;;;x
creature_amazon_desc;This person is from one of the Amazon tribes of Lustria. Not much is known about the Amazons, except that they are a strictly matriarchal society, and have some ties to the old ones. Being insular bordering on paranoid, it is unlikely that much more will be known about them any time soon. Most men who enter their domain are never heard from again.;;;;;;;;;;x
ulthuan;Island Continent of Ulthuan;;;;;;;;;;x
ulthuan_desc;Ulthuan is a magical island continent, but the great vortex at its heart, which keeps the Winds of Chaos at bay has unpredictable effects on Elves who are all sensitive to magic.

ulthuan_severely_depopulated_desc;A wild and untamed province, the few Elves remaining here are clustered around their lords who manage only to patrol the immediate surrounds. Gone are the high days of might, and the armies that once marched to war from here are a distant memory. Though few in number, however, the remaining Elves are determined to defend what is theirs until the last breath and they are amongst the toughest warriors that Ulthuan has to offer.;;;;;;;;;;x
