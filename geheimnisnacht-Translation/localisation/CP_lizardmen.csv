lizardman_sleepingslann_desc;To the Slann, time passes more quickly than it does for short-lived creatures, and Slann will regularly slip into extended periods of restful contemplation that might last decades, or even centuries, at a time. They sit unmoving on their stone palanquins or in their Star Chambers, and to an outsider a Slann might appear asleep, or even dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

slann_awaken_decision_desc;Awakening to the world allows Slann to communicate directly with their subjects, without going through a Skink Priest first. In game terms, this means you are no longer in a regency.\n\nAwakening will cost 100 piety for every level of sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

lizardman101desc;Since the Great Catastrophe, the world has been tainted by the mark of Chaos. The immense power and attunement to magic of the Slann makes their minds vulnerable, and when they awaken from their deep contemplation, their spirits become clouded by unreason and uncertainty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lizardman102desc;The march of ages and the power of Chaos takes a steady toll on the mind of the Slann. Only through deep contemplation and avoiding all contact with this tainted world can they protect their souls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lizardman103desc;The deep contemplation of the Great Plan and the will of the Old Ones is soothing. Memories of a world, untainted by Chaos, can set the mind back on its straight path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

lighter_sleep_decision_desc;The minds of the Slann are ever at risk of corruption and misdirection by the forces of Chaos. Ascending to a lighter level of contemplation will make it easier to completely rouse from your sleep, but you will also be more exposed to the forces of madness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

lizardman261desc;Keeping the dense jungle of Lustria at bay is a constant and dangerous struggle. The jungle expands with unnatural speed, and unless it is regularly cut back by burning and felling trees, it will soon overwhelm any settlement, even those of the Lizardmen - but the workers are at constant risk of being killed by animal and plant alike.

lizardman400desc;Long ago, in the time when Chaos came to the world, Oxyotl was one of the rarest breeds of Skink: a Chameleon who could control the colour of his scales at will. He and his band defended Mage-Lord Pocaxalan in his last-ditch effort to save the city with a great spell. But alas, the fickle powers of Chaos tricked Pocaxalan, and he tapped too deeply into the howling Winds of Magic   The Slann and his last protectors were sucked into the Realm of Chaos.\n\nNo more Chameleon Skinks spawned after the disappearance of Oxyotl. Now, somehow, he has returned from the Realm of Chaos, and the Chameleons have begun to appear again. Chameleon Skinks do not dwell within the temple-cities, but instead strike out deep into the Lustrian jungles. During invasions or times of war, they appear to put themselves at the disposal of the Skink Chiefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_hexoatl_desc;Hexoatl, the City of the Sun, is the most northerly temple-city in Lustria, located on the Isthmus of Pahaux. As such, it is the first line of defence against armies invading Lustria from the north. It is the most martial temple-city, defended with high walls and surrounded by an energy shield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ca_itza_desc;Itza, the First City, is the oldest Temple-City of the Lizardmen. During the Great Catastrophe the city was ravaged by the forces of Chaos and was only saved through the sacrifice made by the Venerable Lord Kroak, the renowned Slann Mage-Priest. Summoning the Deliverance of Itza, he banished every daemon in the city, but in doing so seared all other spells from his mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ca_tlaxtlan_desc;Tlaxtlan, known as the City of the Moon, was once renowned for its astromancers and prognosticators. They observed the moon and the stars in order to make accurate predictions of future events. However with the Great Catastrophe and the appearance of the second moon in the skies above Tlaxtlan their powers waned, as the mone is comprised of pure Chaos and did not obey the laws of the universe, which governed the original moons orbit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ct_xlanhuapec_desc;Xlanhuapec, known as the City of the Mists, was the second city-temple to be built. It is perpetually shrouded in thick mist, so much so one can travel through the entirety of the city without realizing of its existance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
