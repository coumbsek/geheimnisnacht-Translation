high_magic_lore.1;The Winds of Magic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
high_magic_lore.1_desc;The swirling essence of Chaos itself, the very winds of magic itelf flows through you with the energy of that accursed void. Their swirling energies are potent and rich, and the air crackles with these arcane and unfathomable energies of pure corruption, testing, tasting, twisting all the mundane world.

high_magic_lore.2_desc;High Magic is quite simply magic in its purest form. Those who have mastered this most challenging of lores hold the entire spectrum of magic at their command.

The truly gifted can even becalm the Winds of Magic themselves, collapsing a raging tempest until naught but a gentle breeze remains. With but a wave of his hand, a High Mage can call down the wrath of the heavens, paralyse his foes, or immolate whole regiments with Asuryan's Fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
