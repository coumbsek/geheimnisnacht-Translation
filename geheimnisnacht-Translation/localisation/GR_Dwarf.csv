EVTDESCDWARF.0;While on a border patrol, a courtier won a great victory against a hostile force. He tore through a number of enemies, like a true Dwarf should!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTDWARF.0.b;I could have done just as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESCDWARF.1;While patrolling, this courtier's troops encountered many enemies of our hold. Instead of standing to fight, he fled and left his brothers to die! He brought shame on his family!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTDWARF.1.b;Imprison him! His fate shall be decided later.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESCDWARF.2;Underneath every Dwarf hold, there are uncountable caves and tunnels, holding forgotten secrets. Will you join the tunnel fighters and explore them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTDWARF.2.a;Time to go tunneling!;C'est l'heure d'aller creuser !;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESCDWARF.3;Whatever the cause, you were maimed by forces from below. The tunnelers, seeing you as a threat and a burden, lead you back home. No more tunneling for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTTOPTDWARF.3.a;Ah, well. I brought honour to my clan nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;xx;;;;
EVTDESCDWARF.4;You have been underground for a long time now and amassed great wealth in the meantime. Perhaps it is time to rest for now, before your luck runs out?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTDWARF.4.a;Yes, time to go home and see to my wealth...;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
NO_I_MUST_CONTINUE_TUNNELING;No, I must continue tunneling!;;;;;;;;;;;;xx;;;;
EVTDESCDWARF.5;Do you wish to stop searching the tunnels, and return to your home?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESCDWARF.6;While searching the tunnels, your group happens upon an unknown opening in the wall. Do you want to look into it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
BETTER_TO_LEAVE_THIS_ALONE;Better to leave this alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTDWARF.6.a;We won't get rich as cowards! On we go!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESCDWARF.7;As you delve into the tunnel, you see some new ore deposits. As proof, you grab some nuggets and mark the location on your map.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
ONE_FOR_ME_ONE_FOR_PA;One for me, one for Pa...;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESCDWARF.8;As you delve into the depths, you keep looking for something worthwhile. Suddenly, you hear warning calls from behind - It's a dead end, and a trap! You will have to fight to get out of there!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
FIGHT_FOR_YOUR_LIFE;Fight for our lives!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESCDWARF.9;Suddenly, wild screams echo through the tunnels. A horde of Night Goblins descends upon your crew! What will you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTDWARF.9.a;Jump into the fray! There is no honour for cowards!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTDWARF.9.b;Better leave that to the professionals...;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESCDWARF.10;You join into the shield wall of the other fighters, and soon the Night Goblins are upon you! Strength and discipline against fury and masses...;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTDWARF.10.a;For Grimnir, and our Ancestors!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTDWARF.11;You are not as experienced as the others, and you are aware of it. You decide to leave these ones to them, and stay behind the shield wall.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTDWARF.11.a;Good job, you guys! Let them have it, and get us out of here!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESCDWARF.12;You and the others fight on, but in the end, there are just too many Goblins. They are EVERYWHERE, and your group tries to fall back...;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTDWARF.12.a;We have to survive this! Fall back!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESCDWARF.13;In the end, they are still just Goblins. Your group easily takes down a few dozen, and the rest run for their lives. In the end, you killed most of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTDWARF.13.a;Hah! That was nothing. You should see me when I'm serious...;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESCDWARF.14;While searching the tunnels, your men come upon an ancient structure of your kin. They are wary of searching it, fearing ambushes or other threats. What will you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTDWARF.14.a;Go ahead and enter the place myself. We have to find out what this was for!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTDWARF.14.b;Leave this be. We do not want to disturb anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESCDWARF.15;You enter the unknown building, but don't recognize anything. Kicking open one door, you find the sarcophagus of another Dwarf. You just desecrated a tomb!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
CURSES!;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESCDWARF.16;As you enter the building, you recognize some of the runes on the entrance. And the engravings on the inside. This is an old shrine of Grungni! You immediately begin a prayer, and then search for relics of old to take home, to safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTDWARF.16.a;We have truly been blessed by him!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESCDWARF.17;You have been wounded, and can no longer carry on searching the tunnels with the others. It is time to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
IF_I_HAVE_TO;If I have to...;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

dwarfunification0desc;You have taken some time to look at things, and realized that the High Kingdom needs a new push to reunite. You're both known and renowned enough to give that push and be elected by a council of kings as the new High king. Will you call the others to your court?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
dwarfunification0A;Yes, the time has come!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
dwarfunification0B;No, things are fine right now!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
dwarfunification1desc;The messengers quickly reach every hold that the Dwarfs still maintain - A Hold King called for a Council of Kings, something not done in centuries, to elect a new, proper High King. The other kings at least humour the meeting, it seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
dwarfunification2desc;This Dwarf, renowned and powerful from what you heard, has called a Council of Kings and declared his High Kingship true and the old line powerless. Do you assist this claimant?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
dwarfunification2A;Yes, let the holds stand united once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;
dwarfunification2B;No, I'll never accept this beardling as my King!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
dwarfunification3desc;You have sworn to serve the new High King, and therefore, the old kingship is of no importance anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
dwarfunification4desc;My High King, I declare your word as truthful and accept your declaration of High Kingship. Let Karak Ankor reunite and the enemies of our clans tremble!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
dwarfunification4A;Well said. Have an Ale, and slay the Greenskins!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
dwarfunification5desc;You declare your unwillingness to serve a usurper High King, but many of your clan aren't entirely with you on that...;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
dwarfunification5A;Bah, let them grumble!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
dwarfunification6desc;I will never willingly serve you, Pretender-King! Son of a Grobi Shaman and a She-troll! Come and face us, if you dare...;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
dwarfunification6A;Well, we'll see how he fares alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
claim_the_high_kingship; Claim the High Kingship;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
claim_the_high_kingship_desc; Call in the Council of Kings, to declare yourself High King!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
dwarfunification7desc;Word spreads around the world quickly - a Dwarf proclaimed his right to rule as the High King, and the other Dwarfs are gathering to agree or reject his terms. A new age for the Dwarfs might dawn...;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
